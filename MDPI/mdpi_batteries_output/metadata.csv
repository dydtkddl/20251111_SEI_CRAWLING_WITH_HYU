Engineering Dry Electrode Manufacturing for Sustainable Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Mohamed Djihad Bouguern, Anil Kumar Madikere Raghunatha Reddy, Xia Li, Sixu Deng, Harriet Laryea, Karim Zaghib",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10010039,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/39/pdf?version=1706059967,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/39,44,"The pursuit of industrializing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with exceptional energy density and top-tier safety features presents a substantial growth opportunity. The demand for energy storage is steadily rising, driven primarily by the growth in electric vehicles and the need for stationary energy storage systems. However, the manufacturing process of LIBs, which is crucial for these applications, still faces significant challenges in terms of both financial and environmental impacts. Our review paper comprehensively examines the dry battery electrode technology used in LIBs, which implies the use of no solvents to produce dry electrodes or coatings. In contrast, the conventional wet electrode technique includes processes for solvent recovery/drying and the mixing of solvents like N-methyl pyrrolidine (NMP). Methods that use dry films bypass the need for solvent blending and solvent evaporation processes. The advantages of dry processes include a shorter production time, reduced energy consumption, and lower equipment investment. This is because no solvent mixing or drying is required, making the production process much faster and, thus, decreasing the price. This review explores three solvent-free dry film techniques, such as extrusion, binder fibrillation, and dry spraying deposition, applied to LIB electrode coatings. Emphasizing cost-effective large-scale production, the critical methods identified are hot melting, extrusion, and binder fibrillation. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the solvent-free dry-film-making methods, detailing the underlying principles, procedures, and relevant parameters. Full article"

The rapid development of LIBs has led to increased production efficiency and lower costs for manufacturers, resulting in a growing demand for batteries and their application across various industries, particularly in different types of vehicles. In order to meet the demand for LIBs while minimizing climate-impacting emissions, the reuse, recycling, and repurposing of LIBs is a critical step toward achieving a sustainable battery economy. This paper provides a comprehensive review of lithium-ion battery recycling, covering topics such as current recycling technologies, technological advancements, policy gaps, design strategies, funding for pilot projects, and a comprehensive strategy for battery recycling. Additionally, this paper emphasizes the challenges associated with developing LIB recycling and the opportunities arising from these challenges, such as the potential for innovation and the creation of a more sustainable and circular economy. The environmental implications of LIB recycling are also evaluated with methodologies able to provide a sustainability analysis of the selected technology.

Pretreatment of Lithium Ion Batteries for Safe Recycling with High-Temperature Discharging Approach,"Arpita Mondal, Yuhong Fu, Wei Gao, Chunting Chris Mi",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10010037,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/37/pdf?version=1705834349,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/37,15,"The ongoing transition toward electric vehicles is a major factor in the exponential rise in demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). There is a significant effort to recycle battery materials to support the mining industry in ensuring enough raw materials and avoiding supply disruptions, so that there will be enough raw materials to produce LIBs. Nevertheless, LIBs that have reached the end of their useful lives and are sent for recycling may still have some energy left in them, which could be dangerous during handling and processing. Therefore, it is important to conduct discharge pretreatment of LIBs before dismantling and crushing them, especially in cases where pyrometallurgical recycling is not used. Electrochemical discharge in conducting solutions has been commonly studied and implemented for this purpose, but its effectiveness has yet to be fully validated. Non-electrochemical discharge has also been researched as a potentially cleaner and more efficient discharge technology at the same time. This article presents a non-electrochemical discharge process by completely draining the energy from used batteries before recycling. A comprehensive investigation of the behavior of LIBs during discharge and the amount of energy remaining after fully discharging the battery at different temperatures is analyzed in this work. According to the experimental findings, completely discharging the battery at higher temperatures results in a reduced amount of residual energy in the battery. This outcome holds great importance in terms of safe and environmentally friendly recycling of used LIBs, emphasizing that safety and environmentally friendly recycling must go hand in hand with a cost-effective and sustainable solution.

As a result, there has been a swift increase in the sales of electric vehicles (EVs) that use lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). When LIBs reach their end of life in EVs, it may still be possible to use them in other, less demanding applications, giving them a second life. This article describes a case study where the feasibility of a hypothetical business repurposing Tesla Model S/X batteries in the Ostrobothnia region, Finland, is investigated. A material-flow analysis is conducted to estimate the number of batteries becoming available for second-life applications from both the Ostrobothnia region and Finland up to 2035. The cost of repurposing batteries is evaluated for four different scenarios, with the batteries being processed either on the pack, module, or cell level. Three scenarios were found to be feasible, with repurposing costs of 27.2–38.3 EUR/kWh. The last scenario, in which all battery packs are disassembled at the cell level, was found not to be feasible due to the labor intensiveness of disassembly and testing at the cell level. This work gives indications of the potential for repurposing batteries in the Ostrobothnia region and Finland. Full article"

However, the substantial volume expansion and low conductivity severely hinder the cycling performance of Bi-based DBs. In this study, a carbon-layer-coated Bi nanocomposite (Bi@C) was synthesized by pyrolyzing a metal–organic framework (Bi-MOF) containing Bi using a straightforward method. The results show that the Bi@C synthesized under the condition of annealing at 700 °C for 2 h has the optimum properties. The Bi@C has good multiplication performance, and the desalination capacity is 106.1 mg/g at a high current density of 1000 mA/g. And the material exhibited a high desalination capacity of 141.9 mg/g at a current density of 500 mA/g and retained 66.9% of its capacity after 200 cycles. In addition, the Bi@C can operate at a wide range of NaCl concentrations from 0.05 to 2 mol/L. The desalination mechanism analysis of the Bi@C revealed that the carbon coating provides space for Bi particles to expand in volume, thereby mitigating the issues of electrode material powdering and shedding. Meanwhile, the porous carbon skeleton establishes electron and ion channels to enhance the electrode material’s conductivity.

Investigation of Heat Transfer Enhancement Techniques on a Scalable Novel Hybrid Thermal Management Strategy for Lithium-Ion Battery Packs,"Seham Shahid, Martin Agelin-Chaab",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10010032,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/32/pdf?version=1705578382,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/32,3,"This paper introduces a novel hybrid thermal management strategy, which uses secondary coolants (air and fluid) to extract heat from a phase change material (paraffin), resulting in an increase in the phase change material’s heat extraction capability and the battery module’s overall thermal performance. A novel cold plate design is developed and placed between the rows and columns of the cells. The cold plate contains a single fluid body to improve the thermal performance of the battery module. Experimental studies were conducted to obtain the temperature and heat flux profiles of the battery module. Moreover, a numerical model is developed and validated using the experimental data obtained. The numerical data stayed within ±2% of the experimental data. In addition, the ability of nanoparticles to increase the thermal conductivity of water is examined and it is found that the cooling from the liquid cooling component is not sensitive enough to capture the 0.32 W/m K increase in the thermal conductivity of the fluid. Furthermore, in order to enhance the air cooling, fins were added within the air duct to the cold plate. However, this is not feasible, as the pressure drop through the addition of the fins increased by ~245%, whereas the maximum temperature of the battery module reduced by only 0.6 K. Finally, when scaled up to an entire battery pack at a high discharge rate of 7 C, the numerical results showed that the overall temperature uniformity across the pack was 1.14 K, with a maximum temperature of 302.6 K, which was within the optimal operating temperature and uniformity ranges. Therefore, the developed thermal management strategy eliminates the requirement of a pump and reservoir and can be scaled up or down according to the energy and power requirements. Full article"

Lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON), functioning as an amorphous solid electrolyte, is extensively employed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) owing to its remarkable stability and mechanical strength, which is beneficial for effectively mitigating dendrite growth. Nevertheless, the significant challenge arises from the volume changes in the Li metal anode during cycling, leading to the vulnerability of LiPON due to its high rigidity, which impedes the widespread use of LiPON. To address this problem, our study introduces a lithium-boron (Li-B) alloy as the anode, featuring a 3D structure, which can be synergistic with the artificial LiPON layer during cycling, leading to a better performance. The average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of a Li || Cu half-cell reaches 95% over 120 cycles.

Recycling of Valuable Metals from the Priority Lithium Extraction Residue Obtained through Hydrogen Reduction of Spent Lithium Batteries,"Yong Guo, Fupeng Liu, Feixiong Chen, Zaoming Chen, Hong Zeng, Tao Zhang, Changquan Shen",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10010028,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/28/pdf?version=1704986813,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/28,9,"The selective separation of lithium from spent ternary positive materials is achieved through hydrogen reduction followed by water leaching. Almost 98% of the Li is transformed into soluble LiOH⋅H 2 O, while the Ni, Co and Mn species are all transformed into insoluble metals or their oxides, so the recovery of Ni, Co and Mn at this stage is challenging. The traditional acid leaching process has drawbacks such as high oxidant consumption, the low recovery of valuable metals and high production costs. Thus, sulfation roasting followed by water leaching was studied in this project. The leaching levels of Ni, Co, Mn and Al reached 87.13%, 99.87%, 96.21% and 94.95%, respectively, with 1.4 times the theoretical amount of sulfuric acid used at 180 °C for 120 min. To avoid the adverse effects of Mn and Al on the quality of the Ni and Co sulfate products, Mn 2+ was first separated and precipitated via the KMnO 4 oxidation–precipitation method, and >98% of the Mn was removed and precipitated within 30 min with a K p /K t (ratio of actual usage to theoretical usage of KMnO 4 ) of 1.0 at pH = 2.0 and 25 °C. After removal of the Mn, the solvent extraction method was adopted by using P204 as an extractant to separate Al. More than 98% of the Al was extracted in 30 min with 20% ( v / v ) P204 + 10% ( v / v ) TBP with an A/O ratio of 1:1 at 30 °C. This optimized process for extracting lithium residues improved the hydrogen reduction process of waste lithium batteries and will enable industrialization of the developed processes. Full article"

However, because environmental perturbations are not taken into account during the assessment, the accuracy and reliability of the assessment are limited. Thus, a health assessment model for lithium-ion batteries based on evidence reasoning rules with dynamic reference value (ER-DRV) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering that the data are subject to changes, dynamic reference values, real-time weights, and real-time reliability were utilized in the model to ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of the assessment. Moreover, an enhanced optimization method based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) was developed to improve the accuracy of the assessment model.

However, their practical use is hampered by poor cycling stability due to the large size of K + . Therefore, it is critical to develop a structural design that effectively suppresses large volume changes. This study presents a simple method of using a salt template to fabricate porous microspheres (p-MoSe 2 @C MS) of MoSe 2 and a carbon matrix as anode materials in KIBs. These microspheres have a distinct porous design, with uniformly distributed MoSe 2 nanocrystals embedded in the carbon matrix to prevent MoSe 2 overgrowth due to material diffusion during heat treatment. The manufacturing process combined one-step spray drying with recyclable NaCl as a hard template. Through a two-step thermal process under an inert atmosphere, the initial dextrin, NaCl, and Mo salt microspheres were converted into a p-MoSe 2 @N MS composite. The carbon structure derived from the dextrin maintained the shape of the microspheres when NaCl was removed, ensuring no overgrowth of MoSe 2 . This well-designed porous structure improves the interaction with the electrolyte, facilitating the transport of ions and electrons and reducing the K + diffusion distances. In addition, the porous carbon structure accommodates large volume changes during cycling and maintains its structural strength. As a result, p-MoSe 2 @C MS composite exhibits superior electrochemical properties, with remarkable capacity, long-term cycling stability (193 mA h g −1 after 500 cycles at 2.0 A g −1 ), and rate capability.

The aim is to evaluate the capability of two ANNs, one for predicting the cell potential and one for the overpotential under various operating conditions. The two-dimensional model, previously validated with experimental data, was used to generate data to train and test the ANNs. The results show that the first ANN precisely predicts the cell voltage under different states of charge and current density conditions in both the charge and discharge modes. The second ANN, which is responsible for the overpotential calculation, can accurately predict the overpotential across the cell domains, with the lowest confidence near high-gradient areas such as the electrode membrane and domain boundaries. Furthermore, the computational time is substantially reduced, making ANNs a suitable option for the fast understanding and optimisation of VRFBs. Full article"

Herein, we present the utilization of in situ/operando X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to investigate the temperature-dependent behavior of the Li 3 InCl 6 electrolyte. Confirmed by these methods, significant changes in the Li 3 InCl 6 ionic conductivity at 70 °C were observed due to phase transformation. The observed behavior provides critical information for practical applications of the Li 3 InCl 6 solid-state electrolyte in a broad temperature range, contributing to the enhancement of lithium-ion solid-state batteries through their improved morphology, chemical interactions, and structural integrity.

Consideration of engineering and geometrically corrected stress experiments shows that the increasing contact area dominates the stress increase observed during the compression, not strain hardening, of lithium. Under static loading, the lithium metal stress relaxes, which means there is a speed of deformation (engineering strainrate limit of 6.4 × 10 − 5 6.4 × 10 − 5 s − 1 − 1 ) where there is no increase in stress during compression. Constant displacement tests show that stress relaxation depends on the initial applied stress and the amount of athermal plastic work within the material. The finite element analysis shows that barrelling during compression and the requirement for high applied stresses to compress lithium with a small height-to-width ratio are friction and geometric effects, respectively. The outcomes of this work are discussed in relation to the diminishing returns of stack pressure, the difficulty in closing voids, and potential methods for designing and producing sub-micron lithium anodes.

A Novel Quick Temperature Prediction Algorithm for Battery Thermal Management Systems Based on a Flat Heat Pipe,"Weifeng Li, Yi Xie, Wei Li, Yueqi Wang, Dan Dan, Yuping Qian, Yangjun Zhang",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10010019,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/19/pdf?version=1704332531,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/1/19,4,"Predicting the core temperature of a Li-ion battery is crucial for precise state estimation, but it is difficult to directly measure. Existing quick temperature-predicting approaches can hardly consider the thermal mass of complex structure that may cause time delays, particularly under high C-rate dynamic conditions. In this paper, we developed a quick temperature prediction algorithm based on a thermal convolution method (TCM) to calculate the core temperature of a flat heat pipe-based battery thermal management system (FHP-BTMS) under dynamic conditions. The model could predict the core temperature rapidly through convolution of the thermal response map which contains full physical information. Firstly, in order to obtain a high fidelity spatio-temporal temperature distribution, the thermal capacitance-resistance network (TCRN) of the FHP-BTMS is established and validated by constant and dynamic discharging experiments. Then, the response map of the core temperature motivated by various impulse heat sources and heat sinks is obtained. Specifically, the dynamic thermal characteristics of an FHP are discussed to correct the boundary conditions of the TCM. Afterwards, the temperature prediction performances of the TCM and a lumped model under different step operating conditions are compared. The TCM results show a 70–80% accuracy improvement and better dynamic adaptivity than the lumped model. Lastly, a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) profile is employed. The temperature prediction accuracy results show that the TCM can maintain a relative error below 5% throughout the entire prediction period. Full article"

In today’s microgrids, which lack synchronous generation, physical inertia is substituted for inertia emulation. To date, the most effective approach remains the frequency derivative control technique. Nevertheless, within this method, the ability to provide virtual drooping is often disregarded in its design, potentially leading to inadequate development in systems featuring high renewable penetration and low damping. To address this issue, this paper introduces an innovative design and analysis of virtual inertia control to simultaneously mimic droop and inertia characteristics in microgrids. The dynamic frequency response without and with renewable energy sources penetration is comparatively analyzed by simulation. The proposed virtual inertia control employs a derivative technique to measure the rate of change of frequency slope during inertia emulation. Sensitivity mapping is conducted to scrutinize its impact on dynamic frequency response. Finally, the physical battery storage system of the University of Cuenca microgrid is used as a case study under operating conditions. Full article"

The MSOBC aims to modularise the battery units in the energy storage system of the EV to provide better safety and improved operation. This is mainly achieved by reducing the voltage of the battery packs without sacrificing the performance required by the HV system. The proposed MSOBC is an integrated OBC which can operate the EV during traction and braking, as well as charge the battery units. The MSOBC is composed of several submodules consisting of a full-bridge voltage source converter connected on the ac side and SEPIC converter installed on the battery side. The SEPIC converter controls the battery segments with a continuous current because it has an input inductor which can smooth the battery’s currents without the need for large electrolytic capacitors. The isolated version of the SEPIC converter is employed to enhance the system’s safety by providing galvanic isolation between the batteries and the ac output side. This paper presents the necessary control loops to ensure the optimal operation of the EV with the MSOBC in terms of charge and temperature balance without disturbing the required modes of operation.

However, their electrochemical performances are seriously plagued by the shuttling of intermediate polysulfides and the slow reaction kinetics during practical implementation. Herein, we designed a freestanding flexible membrane composed of nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers anchoring iron and zinc single atoms (FeZn-PCNF), to serve as the polysulfide barrier and the reaction promotor. The flexible porous networks formed by the interwoven carbon nanofibers not only offer fast channels for the transport of electrons/ions, but also guarantee the structural stability of the all-in-one multifunctional interlayer during cycling. Highly dispersed Fe and Zn atoms in the carbon scaffold synergistically immobilize sulfur species and expedite their reversible conversion. Therefore, employing FeZn-PCNF as the freestanding interlayer between the cathode and separator, the Li-S battery delivers a superior initial reversible discharge capacity of 1140 mA h g −1 at a current density of 0.5 C and retains a high capacity of 618 mA h g −1 after 600 cycles at a high current density of 1 C.

In this study, novel pore-filled anion-exchange membranes (PFAEMs) for application to a NAPFB employing metal polypyridyl complexes (i.e., Fe(bpy) 3 2+ /Fe(bpy) 3 3+ and Co(bpy) 3 2+ /Co(bpy) 3 3+ ) as the redox species are successfully developed. A porous polyethylene support with excellent solvent resistance and mechanical strength is used for membrane fabrication. The PFAEMs are prepared by filling an ionic liquid monomer containing an imidazolium group and a crosslinking agent into the pores of the support film and then performing in situ photopolymerization. As a result, the prepared membranes exhibit excellent mechanical strength and stability in a non-aqueous medium as well as high ion conductivity. In addition, a low crossover rate for redox ion species is observed for the prepared membranes because they have relatively low swelling characteristics in non-aqueous electrolyte solutions and low affinity for the metal-complex redox species compared to a commercial membrane. Consequently, the PFAEM is revealed to possess superior battery performance than a commercial membrane in the NARFB tests, showing high energy efficiency of about 85% and stable operation for 100 cycles.

However, due to cycling, environmental, and operating conditions, battery capacity tends to degrade over time. Capacity fade is a common indicator of battery state of health (SOH) because it is an indication of how the capacity has been degraded. However, battery capacity cannot be measured directly, and thus, there is an urgent need to develop methods for estimating battery capacity in real time. By analyzing the historical data of a battery in detail, it is possible to predict the future state of a battery and forecast its remaining useful life. This study developed a real-time, simple, and fast method to estimate the cycle capacity of a battery during the charge cycle using only data from a short period of each charge cycle. This proposal is attractive because it does not require data from the entire charge period since batteries are rarely charged from zero to full. The proposed method allows for simultaneous and accurate real-time prediction of the health and remaining useful life of the battery over its lifetime. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested using experimental data from several lithium-ion batteries with different cathode chemistries under various test conditions. Full article"

In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines model-based and data-driven techniques to predict battery state variables, i.e., the state of charge (SoC), voltage, and current. Our proposal leverages enhanced deep reinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep q-learning (DQN), by combining q-learning with neural networks to optimize the VRFB-specific parameters, ensuring a robust fit between the real and simulated data. Our proposed method outperforms the existing approach in voltage prediction. Subsequently, we enhance the proposed approach by incorporating a second deep RL algorithm—dueling DQN—which is an improvement of DQN, resulting in a 10% improvement in the results, especially in terms of voltage prediction. The proposed approach results in an accurate VFRB model that can be generalized to several types of redox-flow batteries. Full article"

Since the major source of anthropogenic Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) is fossil fuel combustion, in the shipping sector, these measures are oriented toward a reduction in tailpipe emissions, where the replacement of traditional internal combustion marine engines with zero-carbon technologies offers the ultimate emission reduction results. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG strategy, vessels involved in international shipping must achieve a minimum 50% reduction in their GHG emissions by 2050. However, this requirement does not extend to fishing vessels, which are significant consumers of fossil fuels.

Float currents are defined as the steady-state trickle charge current after a transient part. In the literature, a correlation to capacity loss was reported. Assuming the float current compensates for the voltage decay over time and is linked to calendar aging, effects from voltage slippery must be considered. The dU/dQ analysis suggests solely a loss of active lithium. Therefore, we investigate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth as the general aging mechanism to explain the origin of float currents. Our results show that the voltage slippery theory holds true within the low to middle test voltage ranges. However, the theory’s explanatory power begins to diminish at higher voltage ranges, suggesting the existence of additional, yet unidentified, factors influencing the float current. A shuttle reaction or lithiation of the cathode by electrolyte decomposition are the most promising alternative aging mechanisms at high voltages. The paper proposes a unique voltage slippery model to check for correlations between aging mechanisms, the float current test and the check-up test. For a better understanding, test strategies are proposed to verify/falsify the aging mechanisms beyond SEI. Full article"

Nevertheless, they have the potential to experience thermal runaway (TR), the prevention and containment of which require safety measures and intensive thermal management. This study introduces a novel combined thermal management and safety application designed for large aspect-ratio battery cells such as pouches and thin prismatics. It comprises polymer-based mini-channel cold plates that can indirectly thermally condition the batteries’ faces with liquid. They are lightweight and space-saving, making them suitable for mobile systems. Furthermore, this study experimentally clarifies to which extent the application of polymer mini-channel cold plates between battery cells is suitable to delay TR by heat dissipation and to prevent thermal runaway propagation (TRP) to adjacent cells by simultaneously acting as a thermal barrier. NMC pouch cells of 12.5 Ah capacity were overcharged at 1 C to induce TR. Without cold plates, TR and TRP occurred within one hour. Utilizing the polymer mini-channel cold plates for face cooling, the overcharge did not produce a condition leading to cell fire in the same time frame. When the fluid inlet temperature was varied between 5 and 40 °C, the overcharged cell’s surface temperature peaked between 50 and 60 °C. Indications were found that thermal conditioning with the polymer cold plates significantly slowed down parts of the process chain before cell firing. Their peak performance was measured to be just under 2.2 kW/m 2 . In addition, thermal management system malfunction was tested, and evidence was found that the polymer cold plates prevented TRP to adjacent cells. In conclusion, a combined thermal management and safety system made of polymer mini-channel cold plates provides necessary TR-related safety aspects in lithium battery systems and should be further investigated.

Multi-Step Temperature Prognosis of Lithium-Ion Batteries for Real Electric Vehicles Based on a Novel Bidirectional Mamba Network and Sequence Adaptive Correlation,"Hongyu Shen, Yuefeng Liu, Qiyan Zhao, Guoyue Xue, Tiange Zhang, Xiuying Tan",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10100373,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/373/pdf?version=1729507164,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/373,2,"The battery systems of electric vehicles (EVs) are directly impacted by battery temperature in terms of thermal runaway and failure. However, uncertainty about thermal runaway, dynamic conditions, and a dearth of high-quality data sets make modeling and predicting nonlinear multiscale electrochemical systems challenging. In this work, a novel Mamba network architecture called BMPTtery (Bidirectional Mamba Predictive Battery Temperature Representation) is proposed to overcome these challenges. First, a two-step hybrid model of trajectory piecewise–polynomial regression and exponentially weighted moving average is created and used to an operational dataset of EVs in order to handle the problem of noisy and incomplete time-series data. Each time series is then individually labeled to learn the representation and adaptive correlation of the multivariate series to capture battery performance variations in complex dynamic operating environments. Next, a prediction method with multiple steps based on the bidirectional Mamba is suggested. When combined with a failure diagnosis approach, this scheme can accurately detect heat failures due to excessive temperature, rapid temperature rise, and significant temperature differences. The experimental results demonstrate that the technique can accurately detect battery failures on a dataset of real operational EVs and predict the battery temperature one minute ahead of time with an MRE of 0.273%.

The development of fast charging technologies for EVs to reduce charging time and increase operating range is essential to replace traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are efficient energy storage systems in EVs. However, the efficiency of LIBs depends significantly on their working temperature range. However, the huge amount of heat generated during fast charging increases battery temperature uncontrollably and may lead to thermal runaway, which poses serious hazards during the operation of EVs. In addition, fast charging with high current accelerates battery aging and seriously reduces battery capacity. Therefore, an effective and advanced battery thermal management system (BTMS) is essential to ensure the performance, lifetime, and safety of LIBs, particularly under extreme charging conditions. In this perspective, the current review presents the state-of-the-art thermal management strategies for LIBs during fast charging. The serious thermal problems owing to heat generated during fast charging and its impacts on LIBs are discussed. The core part of this review presents advanced cooling strategies such as indirect liquid cooling, immersion cooling, and hybrid cooling for the thermal management of batteries during fast charging based on recently published research studies in the period of 2019–2024 (5 years). Finally, the key findings and potential directions for next-generation BTMSs toward fast charging are proposed. This review offers an in-depth analysis by providing recommendations and potential solutions to develop reliable and efficient BTMSs for LIBs during fast charging. Full article"

It also describes a robust testing methodology used to determine battery SoH accurately, considering discharge rates and using machine learning algorithms for analysis. Machine learning techniques, including classical regression models and Ensemble Learning methods, were developed and calibrated using experimental UAV data to predict SoH accurately. Evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) assess model performance, highlighting the balance between model complexity and generalization. The results demonstrated improved SoH predictions with machine learning models, though complexities may lead to overfitting challenges. The transition from simpler regression models to intricate Ensemble Learning methods is meticulously described, including an assessment of each model’s strengths and limitations.

Sodium-ion technology is now being marketed by industrial promoters who are advocating its workable capacity, as well as its use of readily accessible and cheaper key cell components. Often claimed to be safer than lithium-ion cells, currently only limited scientifically sound safety assessments of sodium-ion cells have been performed. However, the predicted sodium-ion development roadmap reveals that significant variants of sodium-ion batteries have entered or will potentially enter the market soon. With recent experiences of lithium-ion battery failures, sodium-ion battery safety management will constitute a key aspect of successful market penetration. As such, this review discusses the safety issues of sodium-ion batteries, presenting a twofold innovative perspective: (i) in terms of comparison with the parent lithium-ion technology making use of the same working principle and similar flammable non-aqueous solvent basis, and (ii) anticipating the arrival of innovative sub-chemistries at least partially inspired from successive generations of lithium-ion cells. The authors hope that the analysis provided will assist concerned stakeholders in the quest for safe marketing of sodium-ion batteries. Full article"
Inkjet-Printed Silver Lithiophilic Sites on Copper Current Collectors: Tuning the Interfacial Electrochemistry for Anode-Free Lithium Batteries,"Seyedalireza Mirbagheri, Eugenio Gibertini, Luca Magagnin",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10100369,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/369/pdf?version=1729170467,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/369,4,"Anode-free lithium batteries (AFLBs) present an opportunity to eliminate the need for conventional graphite electrodes or excess lithium–metal anodes, thus increasing the cell energy density and streamlining the manufacturing process. However, their attributed poor coulombic efficiency leads to rapid capacity decay, underscoring the importance of achieving stable plating and stripping of Li on the negative electrode for the success of this cell configuration. A promising approach is the utilization of lithiophilic coatings such as silver to mitigate the Li nucleation overpotential on the Cu current collector, thereby improving the process of Li plating/stripping. On the other hand, inkjet printing (IJP) emerges as a promising technique for electrode modification in the manufacturing process of lithium batteries, offering a fast and scalable technology capable of depositing both thin films and patterned structures. In this work, a Fujifilm Dimatix inkjet printer was used to deposit Ag sites on a Cu current collector, aiming to modulate the interfacial electrochemistry of the system. Samples were fabricated with varying areas of coverage and the electrochemical performance of the system was systematically evaluated from bare Cu (non-lithiophilic) to a designed pattern (partially lithiophilic) and the fully coated thin film case (lithiophilic). Increasing lithiophilicity resulted in lower charge transfer resistance, higher exchange current density and reduced Li nucleation overpotential (from 55.75 mV for bare Cu to 13.5 mV for the fully coated case). Enhanced half-cell cyclability and higher coulombic efficiency were also achieved (91.22% CE over 76 cycles for bare Cu, 97.01% CE over 250 cycles for the fully coated case), alongside more uniform lithium deposition and fewer macroscopic irregularities. Moreover, our observations demonstrated that surface patterning through inkjet printing could represent an innovative, easy and scalable strategy to provide preferential Li nucleation sites to guide the subsequent Li deposition.

An Electrochemical Impedance Spectrum-Based State of Health Differential Indicator with Reduced Sensitivity to Measurement Errors for Lithium–Ion Batteries,Jaber Abu Qahouq,2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10100368,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/368/pdf?version=1729138479,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/368,6,"As the use of electrochemical batteries, especially lithium–ion (Li-Ion) batteries, increases due to emerging applications and expanding markets, the accurate and fast estimation of their state of health (SOH) is becoming increasingly important. The accuracy of the SOH estimation is highly dependent on the correlation strength between the used indicator and SOH and the accuracy of the SOH indicator measurement. This paper presents a new differential indicator which has a strong and consistent correlation with the SOH of Li-Ion batteries, based on a new Electrochemical Impedance Spectrum (EIS) Phase–Magnitude relationship. It is shown in this paper that the EIS Phase–Magnitude relationship exhibits a phase-based differential impedance magnitude SOH indicator between a first-phase peak point and a last-phase valley point. Because of the differential nature of this SOH indicator and because the two impedance values are measured at a phase peak point and a valley phase point regardless of the phase absolute values, the effect of impedance measurement shift/offset (error) on SOH estimation is reduced. This supports the future development of more accurate and faster online and offline SOH estimation algorithms and systems that have a higher immunity to impedance measurement shift/offset (error). Furthermore, in this work, the EIS was measured for a lithium–ion battery that was down to a ~15% SOH, which was not only used to support the conclusions of this paper, but also helped in filling a gap in the literature for EIS data under deep/high degradation levels.

This issue necessitates the development of tools and models that can accurately predict battery aging. This study proposes a general framework for constructing battery aging models using machine learning techniques and compares these models with two existing empirical models, including a commercial one. To build the models, the databases produced by EVERLASTING and Bills et al. were utilized. The aim is to create universally applicable models that can address any battery-aging scenario. In this study, three types of models were developed: a vanilla neural network, a neural network inspired by extreme learning machines, and an encoder coupled with a neural network. The inputs for these models are derived from established knowledge in battery science, allowing the models to capture aging effects across different use cases. The models were trained on cells subjected to specific aging conditions and they were tested on other cells from the same database that experienced different aging conditions. The results obtained during the test for the vanilla neural network showed an RMSE of 1.3% on the Bills et al. test data and an RMSE of 2.7% on the EVERLASTING data, demonstrating similar or superior performance compared to the empirical models and proving the ability of the models to capture battery aging.

When inhaled, these particles can cause serious adverse health effects. This study measured the size distributions of particles with diameters less than 10 µm released throughout the TR-driven combustion of cylindrical lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and pouch-style lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) LIB cells. The chemical composition of fine particles (PM 2.5 ) and some acidic gases were also characterized from filter samples. The emission factors of particle number and mass as well as chemical components were calculated. Particle number concentrations were dominated by those smaller than 500 nm with geometric number mean diameters below 130 nm. Mass concentrations were also dominated by smaller particles, with PM 1 particles making up 81–95% of the measured PM 10 mass. A significant amount of organic and elemental carbon, phosphate, and fluoride was released as PM 2.5 constituents. The emission factor of gaseous hydrogen fluoride was 10–81 mg/Wh, posing the most immediate danger to human health.

The materials exhibit a garnet-type zinc hexacyanoferrate framework with large diffusion channels for alkaline ions. Specifically, they show superionic behavior and allow for facile processing into pellets. We compare the structure, stability, and transport properties of lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-containing zinc hexacyanoferrates and find that Na 2 Zn 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 2 achieves the highest ionic conductivity of up to 0.21 mS/cm at room temperature.

However, this typically leads to the battery having lower performance at a high cycling rate, a phenomenon commonly known as rate capacity retention. One solution to this is perforating the electrode, by creating channels or corrugations in the active electrode material, either as holes or as channels. This is known to reduce the rate capacity retention effect, but in order to engineer this better, a simplified transport process analysis needs to be established. In this paper, we propose a classic electrochemical analysis based on voltage–charge cycling measurements in order to obtain a classical mass transport coefficient, h m h m , that is further used as a main indicator for electrode design quality assessment. We also demonstrate theoretically and experimentally how the mass transfer coefficient, h m h m , can be determined and how it changes as the electrode layer thickness increases, with and without electrode corrugations.

To address these challenges and enhance thermal management capabilities, this study introduces a novel composite phase change material (CPCM) synthesized by physically mixing paraffin (PA), expanded graphite (EG), and bacterial cellulose (BC). The thermal performance of CPCMs with varying BC proportions is evaluated, and their impact on temperature control in battery thermal management systems (BTMS) is assessed. The results show that the addition of EG and BC significantly improves the thermal conductivity of the CPCM, reaching a value of 1.39 W·m −1 ·K −1 . This also enhances the uniformity of temperature distribution within the battery module and reduces CPCM leakage. By comparing temperature variations within the battery module under different operating conditions, it was found that the intricate network structure of the CPCM promotes uniform temperature distribution, effectively mitigating temperature rise. Consequently, the maximum temperature and maximum temperature difference within the battery module were maintained below 47 °C and 4 °C, respectively. Compared to a system without phase change material at a 3C discharge rate, the maximum cell temperature, maximum module temperature, and maximum temperature difference were reduced by 32.38%, 26.92%, and 34.94%, respectively. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of BTMS. Full article"

However, their applications still face challenges of poor rate performance and low initial coulomb efficiency (ICE), which are induced by the unstable solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) and sluggish Na + diffusion kinetics in conventional ester-based electrolytes. Herein, inspired by the electrode/electrolyte interfacial chemistry, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is exploited to construct an advanced electrolyte and reveal the relationship between the improved electrochemical performance and the derived SEI film on TiO 2 anode. The robust and homogeneously distributed F-rich SEI film formed in THF electrolyte favors fast interfacial charge transfer dynamics and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, the THF electrolyte endows the TiO 2 anode with greatly improved ICE (64.5%), exceptional rate capabilities (186 mAh g −1 at 5.0 A g −1 ), and remarkable cycling stability.

A notable feature of SIBs is their ability to utilize aluminum current collectors, which are resistant to oxidation, allowing for safer storage at 0 V. However, the long-term impacts of such storage on their electrochemical performance remain poorly understood. This study systematically investigates how storage conditions at various states of charge (SOCs) affect open circuit voltage (OCV) decay, internal resistance, and post-storage cycling stability in two different Na-ion chemistries: Prussian white//hard carbon and layered oxide//hard carbon. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy before and after storage shows a pronounced increase in internal resistance and a corresponding decline in cycling performance when SIBs are stored in a fully discharged state (0 V), particularly for layered oxide-based cells, illustrating the sensitivity of different SIB chemistries to storage conditions. Additionally, a novel reformation protocol is proposed that reactivates cell capacity by rebuilding the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, offering a recovery path after prolonged storage. These insights into the long-term storage effects on SIBs provide new guidelines for optimizing storage and transport conditions to minimize performance degradation, making them more viable for commercial applications.

This study presents a novel BMS tailored for continuous monitoring, transmission, and storage of essential parameters such as voltage, current, and temperature in an NCA 18650 4S lithium-ion battery (LIB) pack during high C-rate testing. By incorporating deep learning, our BMS monitors external battery parameters and predicts LIB’s health in terms of discharge capacity. Two experiments were conducted: a static experiment to validate the functionality of BMS, and an in operando experiment on an electrically propelled vehicle to assess real-world performance under high C-rate abuse testing with vibration. It was found that the external surface temperatures peaked at 55 °C during in operando flight, which was higher than that during static testing. During testing, the deep learning capacity estimation algorithm detected a mean capacity deviation of 0.04 Ah, showing an accurate state of health (SOH) by predicting the capacity of the battery. Our BMS demonstrated effective data collection and predictive capabilities, mirroring real-world conditions during abuse testing. Full article"

However, it remains a great challenge to achieve both high energy density and high-power density while reducing the production costs. Cells with three-dimensional electrodes realized by laser ablation are proven to have enhanced electrochemical performance compared to those with conventional two-dimensional electrodes, especially at fast charging/discharging. Nevertheless, laser structuring of electrodes is still limited in terms of achievable processing speed, and the upscaling of the laser structuring process is of great importance to gain a high technology readiness level. In the presented research, the impact of different laser structuring strategies on the electro-chemical performance was investigated on aqueous processed Li(Ni 0 . 6 Mn 0 . 2 Co 0 . 2 )O 2 cathodes with acid addition during the slurry mixing process. Rate capability analyses of cells with laser structured aqueous processed electrodes exhibited enhanced performance with capacity increases of up to 60 mAh/g at high current density, while a 65% decrease in ionic resistance was observed for cells with laser structured electrodes. In addition, pouch cells with laser structured acid-added electrodes maintained 29–38% higher cell capacity after 500 cycles and their end-of-life was extended by a factor of about 4 in contrast to the reference cells with two-dimensional electrodes containing common organic solvent processed polyvinylidene fluoride binder.

This paper introduces an innovative methodology aimed at homogenizing the mechanical response of Li-ion batteries under compression load, using Finite Element Method (FEM) techniques to improve computational efficiency. A novel approach is proposed, involving the selective application of compression loads solely to the Jelly Roll and its casing, achieved by cutting the battery heads. Through this method, distinct mechanical behaviors are identified within the battery force displacement curve: an elastic region, a zone characterized by plastic deformation, and a segment exhibiting densification. By delineating these regions, our study facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the battery’s mechanical response under compression. Two battery models were employed in this study: one representing the battery as a solid volume, and another featuring the jelly roll as a solid volume enclosed by a shell representing the casing. The material utilized was LS Dyna MAT24, chosen for its piecewise characteristics’ definition, and its validation was primarily conducted through the curve fitting method applied to the force–displacement curve, taking in account the three regions of the compression force behavior. This approach not only optimizes computational resources but also offers insights crucial for enhancing the mechanical stability of Li-ion batteries in automotive applications. Full article"

Multiple models with varying degrees of accuracy and computational cost have been developed to understand and predict dendrite growth. This study presents a simple model to simulate macroscale dendrite growth on lithium metal electrodes. The model uses a 3D single-particle Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) algorithm with an electric field bias to simulate dendrite growth. The electric field bias was introduced into the model with an important parameter, namely the biasing factor c , which determines the balance between diffusion and electric field effects. Before performing the simulation with the proposed model, the dendrite growth in a lithium symmetric cell during charging was measured by sequential 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These data were then used to validate the simulation, as the dendrite structure in each measured MRI time frame was used a starting point for a new simulation, the results of which were then validated with the measured dendrite structure of the next time frame. The best agreement between the simulated and measured dendrite structures using the overlap and displacement of deposition sites metrics was obtained at the biasing factor c = 0.7. This agreement was also good in terms with the fractal dimension of the dendrite structures. The proposed method offers a simple, accurate, and scalable framework for predicting dendrite growth over long deposition periods, making it a valuable tool for studying dendrite suppression under real-world battery charging conditions.

They present various benefits, including lower cost, enhanced safety, and greater energy density compared to the commonly used transition metal oxides. The current trend in lithium-ion batteries is to move to all-solid-state chemistries in order to improve safety and energy density. Several chemistries for solid electrolytes have been studied, tested, and characterized to evaluate the applicability in energy storage system.

A data-driven neural network model is developed to predict the charging efficiency of lithium titanate (LTO) batteries for 5% state of charge (SOC) segments under various charging conditions. By considering the impact of entropy change on the open-circuit voltage (OCV) during the charging process, the accuracy of energy efficiency calculations is improved. Incorporating battery data under various charging conditions, and comparing the predictive accuracy and computational complexity of different hyperparameter configurations, we establish a backpropagation neural network model designed for implementation in embedded systems. The model predicts the energy efficiency of subsequent 5% SOC segments based on the current SOC and operating conditions. The results indicate that the model achieves a prediction error of only 0.29% under unknown charging conditions while also facilitating the deployment of the neural network model in embedded systems.

Nevertheless, several obstacles remain, including the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) into the electrolyte and a restricted operational temperature range. This manuscript presents a promising approach to addressing these challenges. The manuscript describes a straightforward and scalable in situ thermal polymerization method for synthesizing a quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSE) by gelling pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), and a dual salt lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO 3 )-based liquid electrolyte. The resulting freestanding quasi-solid-state electrolyte (QSE) effectively inhibits the polysulfide shuttle effect across a wider temperature range of −25 °C to 45 °C. The electrolyte’s ability to prevent LiPS migration and cluster formation has been corroborated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy analyses. The optimized QSE composition appears to act as a physical barrier, thereby significantly improving battery performance. Notably, the capacity retention has been demonstrated to reach 95% after 100 cycles at a 2C rate. Furthermore, the simple and scalable synthesis process paves the way for the potential commercialization of this technology. Full article"
Improving the Performance of LiFePO4Cathodes with a Sulfur-Modified Carbon Layer,"Su-hyun Kwak, Yong Joon Park",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10100348,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/348/pdf?version=1727764410,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/10/348,6,"LiFePO₄ (LFP) cathodes are popular due to their safety and cyclic performance, despite limitations in lithium-ion diffusion and conductivity. These can be improved with carbon coating, but further advancements are possible despite commercial success. In this study, we modified the carbon coating layer using sulfur to enhance the electronic conductivity and stabilize the carbon surface layer via two methods: 1-step and 2-step processes. In the 1-step process, sulfur powder was mixed with cellulose followed by heat treatment to form a coating layer; in the 2-step process, an additional coating layer was applied on top of the carbon coating layer. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the 1-step sulfur-modified LFP significantly improved the discharge capacity (~152 mAh·g −1 at 0.5 C rate) and rate capability compared to pristine LFP. Raman analyses indicated that sulfur mixed with a carbon source increases the graphitization of the carbon layer. Although the 2-step sulfur modification did not exceed the 1-step process in enhancing rate capability, it improved the storage characteristics of LFP at high temperatures. The residual sulfur elements apparently protected the surface. These findings confirm that sulfur modification of the carbon layer is effective for improving LFP cathode properties, offering a promising approach to enhance the performance and stability of LFP-based lithium-ion batteries.

Compared with other VRFB stack models, this model is more comprehensive in considering the influence of multiple factors. Based on the established model, the electrolyte flow rate distribution across cells in the stack is investigated. The distribution and variation in shunt currents, single-cell current and single-cell voltage are analyzed. The distribution and variation in temperature and heat generation and heat transfer are also researched. It can be found that the VRFB stack temperature will exceed 40 °C when operating at 60 A and 100 mA cm −2 at an ambient temperature of 30 °C, which will lead to electrolyte ion precipitation, affecting the performance and safety of the battery. To control the stack temperature below 40 °C, a new tank cooling control strategy is proposed, and the suitable starting cooling point and the controlled temperature are specified. Compared with the common room cooling strategy, the new tank cooling strategy reduces energy consumption by 27.18% during 20 charge–discharge cycles. Full article"

Graphene oxide was synthesized using Hummers’ method, followed by mixing with LFP, lyophilization, and plasma treatment to obtain LFP@rGO. The plasma treatment achieved the highest degree of reduction and porosity in rGO, creating ion transfer channels. The structure of LFP@rGO was verified through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, which demonstrated that incorporating 10.0 wt% of rGO into LFP resulted in successful coverage by the rGO layer, forming LFP@rGO-10.

Molybdenum (Mo) is expected to replace expensive germanium (Ge) to lower tmaterial costs, reduce sensitivity to ambient water and oxygen, and achieve acceptable Li + conductivity. The ab initio first principle molecular dynamics simulations show that room-temperature Li + conductivity is 1.12 mS·cm −1 for the Li 10 Ge 0.75 Mo 0.25 P 2 S 12 compound, which is comparable to the theoretical value of 6.81 mS·cm −1 and the experimental measured one of 12 mS·cm −1 of the Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 (LGPS) structure. For Li 10 Ge x Mo 1−x P 2 S 12 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1) compounds, the density of states and the projection fractional wave state density were calculated. It was found that when Ge atoms were partially replaced by Mo atoms, the band gap remained unchanged at 2.5 eV, but deep level defects appeared in Mo-substituted compounds. Fortunately, this deep level defect is difficult to ionize at room temperature, so it has no effect on the electronic conductivity of Mo substitute compounds, making Mo substitution a suitable solution for electrolyte materials. The projection fractional wave state density calculation shows that the covalent bond between Mo and S is stronger than that between Ge and S, which reduces the sensitivity of Mo-substituted compounds to water and oxygen contents in the air. In addition, the partial state density coincidence curve between Li and S elements disappears in the 25% Mo-substituted compound with energies of 4–5 eV, indicating that the Li 2 S by-product is decreased.

This article introduces and compares in detail two novel parameter extraction methods based on the distinct application of least squares linear regression in relation to the autoregressive exogenous as well as the state-space equations of the double polarization equivalent circuit model in an iterative optimization-type manner. Following their application using experimental data obtained from an NCA Sony VTC6 cell, the results are benchmarked against a method employing differential evolution. The results indicate the least squares linear regression applied to the state-space format of the model as the best overall solution, providing excellent accuracy similar to the results of differential evolution, but averaging only 1.32% of the computational cost. In contrast, the same linear solver applied to the autoregressive exogenous format proves complementary characteristics by being the fastest process but presenting a penalty over the accuracy of the results.

However, the existing incremental capacity analysis methods, which are mostly based on curve multi-parameter analysis, still have limitations in terms of computation, prediction accuracy, and adaptability to actual operating conditions. This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the incremental capacity (IC) curve and proposes a feature parameter based on the area under the IC curve. By incorporating charge and discharge data, a weighted health indicator sequence is constructed and three mathematical models are proposed to link health indicators with cycle number, capacity, and SOH. The feasibility of using impedance as an additional input is also explored, despite the challenges of measurement, revealing its potential applications. Validation of the models with different datasets shows that the proposed method achieves both average relative error and root mean square error within 5%, outperforming other methods in terms of minimizing error and ensuring stability.

In this study, we investigate the synergistic effects of lithium bis (oxalate) borate (LiBOB), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and adiponitrile (ADN) to develop a formula that is compatible with both elements in the battery. The solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) multi-layer generated from LiBOB and FEC successfully protects the electrolyte from the lithium and suppresses the decomposition of ADN on lithium, identified by the tiny amounts of isonitriles on the surface of the anode. Simultaneously, most of the ADN molecules remain and protect the cathode particles via the absorption layer of the nitrile groups, in the same way that this process works in commercial lithium-ion batteries. Benefiting from the stable interfacial films formed synchronously on the anode and cathode, the Li/LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cells with an area capacity of ~3 mAh cm −2 operate stably beyond 250 cycles and target the accumulated capacity to levels as high as ~653.4 mAh cm −2 .

The commercial viability precludes the use of internal temperature sensors, and existing methodologies for online estimation of internal temperatures under various electrical loads are constrained by computational limitations and model accuracy. This study presents a layered electro-thermal equivalent circuit model (LETECM), developed by integrating a layered second-order fractional equivalent circuit model with a layered thermal equivalent circuit model. A lithium-ion battery divided into three layers was employed to illustrate the development of this LETECM. The model’s precision was validated against a 3D Newman Finite Element Model (3DNFEM), constructed using actual battery parameters. Given that the thermal gradient inside the battery is usually more pronounced under high load conditions, a 10C direct current discharge for 60 s followed by a rest period of 240 s was adopted as the test condition in the simulation. The results indicate that at the end of the DC discharge, the temperature difference between the inner layer and the surface of the battery was the largest and the maximum temperature difference predicted by the LETECM was 3.58 °C, while the 3DNFEM exhibited a temperature difference of 3.74 °C. The trends in each layer temperature and battery surface temperature obtained by the two models are highly consistent. The proposed model offers computational efficiency and maintains notable accuracy, suggesting its potential integration into BMS for real-time online applications. This advancement could provide critical internal temperature data for refining battery charging and discharging performance assessments and lifespan predictions, thereby optimizing battery management strategies.

Guiding homogeneous nucleation during the initial plating stage of lithium is vital to obtain a stable lithium metal anode. Herein, an ultra-thin dipole layer that can be used to regulate the diffusion layer is prepared by anodizing and strong polarization on a titanium foil collector. It is demonstrated that the vertical distributions of ionic concentration and electrostatic potential on the nBTO@Ti electrode are modulated by the ultrathin dipole layer, leading to uniform diffusion of lithium ions and reduction of overpotential. Consequently, a uniform lithium nucleation and plating process are achieved on a polarized BaTiO 3 collector, which is verified by microscopy. The average coulombic efficiency of the deposition-dissolution process is as high as 98.3% for 300 cycles at 0.5 mA cm −2 .

Assessment of a Top and Bottom Cooling Strategy for Prismatic Lithium-Ion Cells Intended for Automotive Use,"Said Madaoui, Bartlomiej Guzowski, Roman Gozdur, Zlatina Dimitrova, Nicolas Audiot, Jocelyn Sabatier, Jean-Michel Vinassa, Franck Guillemard",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10110403,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/11/403/pdf?version=1731924047,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/11/403,1,"In contemporary vehicle applications, lithium-ion batteries have become a leading option among the diverse array of battery technologies available. This preference is attributed to their advantageous properties, which include low self-discharge rates and no memory effect. Despite these benefits, lithium-ion batteries are not without their challenges. The key issues include a restricted driving range, concerns regarding longevity, safety risks, and prolonged charging durations. Efforts aimed at minimizing the charging duration frequently entail the introduction of elevated currents into the battery, a practice that can significantly elevate its temperature and, in turn, diminish its operational lifespan. Generally, battery packs in electric vehicles are equipped with flat cooling plates located on their side or bottom surfaces, which also serve the dual purpose of providing heating in colder conditions. Nevertheless, this cooling configuration faces difficulties during fast charging and may not efficiently heat or cool the batteries. In this work, a novel thermal management approach is proposed, in which a battery module is cooled not only with a bottom cooling plate but also using another cooling plate in contact with the busbars, located on the top of the battery module. The simulations and experimental tests show that this new configuration demonstrates significant improvements. The thermal time constant is reduced by 47%, enabling faster cooling of the module. Additionally, the maximum temperature reached by the battery during charging with dual cooling is lowered by 6 °C compared to the conventional approach. In this configuration, the top cooling plate acts as a thermal bridge. This is a key advantage that promotes temperature homogenization within the battery module. As a result, it supports an even aging process of batteries, ensuring their longevity and optimal performance. Full article"

Over the last twenty years, these HEVs have generated a substantial number of NiMH batteries that are either inoperable, experiencing performance degradation, or approaching the end of their service life. This situation results in a twofold challenge: (i) a growing volume of environmentally hazardous waste due to the difficulty of NiMH battery reclamation and (ii) escalating maintenance costs for HEV owners necessitated by replacement battery purchases. To overcome this scenario, patent WO2015092107A1, published in 2015, proposed a ‘Method for regenerating NiMH batteries.’ This method claimed the ability to restore NiMH batteries to their original functionality based on a non-intrusive approach. However, a comprehensive review of the relevant scientific literature fails to identify any empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of this regeneration technique. Within this context, this study provides a detailed analysis and evaluation of the regeneration process based on an unsupervised and non-intrusive prototype. The proposed prototype can be used not only to implement and evaluate the previous patent, but also to test any other process or methodology based on controlled charging/discharging periods under certain current conditions. NiMH battery cells from a Toyota Prius were included in this work as a real case study. The experimental results from this prototype demonstrate the reduced potential for battery regeneration using the proposed method. Future contributions should offer a promising solution for mitigating the challenges associated with NiMH battery disposal, maintenance within the HEV domain, and other second-life alternative options.

Coating the surface of commonly used stainless steel electrodes with a specific random copolymer brush increases the measured ionic conductivity by more than an order of magnitude compared to the uncoated electrodes. The increase in ionic conductivity is related to the interfacial structure of the block copolymer domain morphology on the electrode surface. We show that the impedance associated with the electrode–electrolyte interface can be detected using nonmetallic electrodes, allowing us to distinguish the ionic conductivity behaviors of the bulk electrolyte and the interfacial layers for both as-prepared and annealed samples.

The ES approach is assisted by the LS method for the rough determination of the lower and upper bound of the ECM parameters, and the NLS approach is incorporated with the Monte Carlo run such that different initial guesses can be assigned to improve the goodness of EIS fitting. The proposed approaches are validated using both simulated and real EIS data. Compared to the LS approach, the ES and NLS approaches show better fitting accuracy at various noise levels, whereas in both the validation using simulated EIS data and actual EIS data collected from LG 18650 and Molicel 21700 batteries, the NLS approach shows better fitting accuracy than that of LS and ES approaches. In all cases, compared with the ES approach, the computational time of the NLS approach is significantly faster, and compared with the LS approach, the NLS approach shows a minimal difference in computational time and considerably better fitting performance.

This study addresses the variability in degradation trajectories by applying gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks alongside principal component analysis (PCA), Granger causality, and K-means clustering to analyze the relationships between operating conditions—such as temperature and load profiles—and battery performance degradation. This paper uses a publicly accessible dataset derived by aging three prismatic LIB cells under a realistic forklift operation profile.

Addressing the non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of battery capacity sequences, a novel method for predicting lithium battery SOH is proposed using a deep hybrid kernel extreme learning machine (DHKELM) optimized by the improved black-winged kite algorithm (IBKA). First, to address the limitations of traditional extreme learning machines (ELMs) in capturing non-linear features and their poor generalization ability, the concepts of auto encoders (AEs) and hybrid kernel functions are introduced to enhance ELM, resulting in the establishment of the DHKELM model for SOH prediction. Next, to tackle the challenge of parameter selection for DHKELM, an optimal point set strategy, the Gompertz growth model, and a Levy flight strategy are employed to optimize the parameters of DHKELM using IBKA before model training. Finally, the performance of IBKA-DHKELM is validated using two distinct datasets from NASA and CALCE, comparing it against ELM, DHKELM, and BKA-DHKELM. The results show that IBKA-DHKELM achieves the smallest error, with an RMSE of only 0.0062, demonstrating exceptional non-linear fitting capability, high predictive accuracy, and good robustness.

This study investigates the impact of laser-ablated geometric structures on the performance of hybrid solid-state batteries (SSBs). A Doyle–Fuller–Newman modeling approach is developed and parameterized for structured hybrid SSBs that incorporate a PEO/LiTFSI SPE and an LLZO ceramic separator, as well as NMC-811 and Li-metal for the positive- and negative-electrode active materials. Comparison between structured and planar cell designs reveals significant rate capability improvements in structured designs due to reduced diffusion and interfacial charge transfer polarization. A sensitivity analysis of geometric structure parameters shows further potential for performance improvement in terms of specific capacity and energy density. However, current constriction effects in the LLZO separator can deteriorate the rate capability. A more general perspective is then taken by analyzing the impact of changing SPE parameters. An energy density of 128 Wh kg −1 at 1C, and 220 Wh kg −1 at 1C with improved SPE parameters is achieved in the best case, approaching the target of 250 Wh kg −1 , which is currently achieved for conventional Li-ion batteries.

Initially, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualise the clustering of the three target gas samples at room temperature, providing a preliminary data analysis. For the classification phase, we chose three classification algorithms—MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), and SVM (Support Vector Machine)—and performed a comprehensive comparison of their classification and generalisation abilities using grid search for hyperparameter optimisation and five-fold cross-validation. The results demonstrated that MLP achieved 99.23% classification accuracy during the 20 s response period. In the concentration regression phase, we combined the classification results with the raw features to create a new feature set, which was then input into a multi-output MLP regression model. The root mean square error (RMSE) employing the new feature set was used to measure the prediction error. Ultimately, the findings showed that the input of combined features significantly reduced the regression error for the mixed gas. Full article"

We address the challenge of extrapolating battery performance from high-rate to low-rate charging conditions, a significant limitation in previous studies. Experiments were also conducted on commercial cells using charge rates from 1C to 3C. Comparative analysis of fully connected neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory networks revealed their limitations in extrapolating to untrained conditions. Our Seq2Seq model overcomes these limitations, predicting charging profiles and discharge capacity for untrained, low-rate conditions using only high-rate charging data. The Seq2Seq model demonstrated superior performance with low error and high curve-fitting accuracy for 1C and 1.2C untrained data. Unlike traditional models, it predicts complete charging profiles (voltage, current, temperature) for subsequent cycles, offering a comprehensive view of battery degradation. This method significantly reduces battery life testing time while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The findings have important implications for lithium-ion battery development, potentially accelerating advancements in electric vehicle technology and energy storage. Full article"
State of Charge Estimation of Lithium Battery Utilizing Strong Tracking H-Infinity Filtering Algorithm,"Tianqing Yuan, Yang Liu, Jing Bai, Hao Sun",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10110388,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/11/388/pdf?version=1730712655,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/11/388,,"The ability to quickly and accurately estimate the state of charge (SOC) of lithium batteries is a key function of the battery management system (BMS). To enhance the accuracy of SOC estimation for lithium batteries, we propose a method that combines the dynamic factor recursive least squares (DFFRLS) algorithm and the strong tracking H-infinity filtering (STF-HIF) algorithm. To address the issue of fixed forgetting factors in recursive least squares (RLS) that struggle to maintain both fast convergence and stability in battery parameter identification, we introduce dynamic forgetting factors. This approach adjusts the forgetting factor based on the residuals between the model’s estimated and actual values. To improve the H-infinity filtering (HIF) algorithm’s poor performance in tracking sudden state changes, we propose a combined STF-HIF algorithm, integrating HIF with strong tracking filtering (STF). Simulation experiments indicate that, compared to the HIF algorithm, the STF-HIF algorithm achieves a maximum absolute SOC estimation error (MaxAE) of 0.69%, 0.72%, and 1.22%, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0.27%, 0.25%, and 0.38%, and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.33%, 0.30%, and 0.46% under dynamic stress testing (DST), federal urban driving schedules (FUDS), and Beijing dynamic stress testing (BJDST) conditions, respectively.

However, Ni-rich cathodes pose challenges in capacity retention due to inherent structural and surface redox instabilities. One promising strategy is to make the Ni-rich NMC material in the form of single-crystal micron-sized particles, as they resist intergranular and surface degradation during cycling. Among various methods to synthesize single-crystal NMC (SC-NMC) particles, molten-salt-assisted calcination offers distinct processing advantages but at present, is not yet optimized or mechanistically clarified to yield the desired control over crystal growth and morphology. In this project, molten-salt-mediated transformation of Ni 0.85 Mn 0.05 Co 0.15 (OH) 2 precursor (P-NMC) particles to LiNi 0.85 Mn 0.05 Co 0.15 O 2 particles is investigated in terms of the crystal growth mechanism and its electrochemical response. Unlike previous studies that involved large volumes of molten salt, using a smaller volume of molten KCl is found to result in larger primary particles with improved cycling performance achieved via partial reactive dissolution and heterogeneous nucleation growth, suggesting that the ratio of molten salt volume to NMC mass is an important parameter in the synthesis of single-crystal Ni-rich NMC materials.

By using different anode materials, these batteries could have an even greater energy density. One material, tin, has a theoretical lithium capacity (994 mAh/g) over three-times higher than commercial carbon anode materials. Unfortunately, to achieve this high capacity, bulk tin undergoes a large volume expansion, and the material pulverizes during cycling, giving a rapid capacity fade. To mitigate this issue, tin must be scaled down to the nano-level to take advantage of unique micromechanics at the nanoscale. Synthesis techniques for Sn nanoparticle anodes are costly and overly complicated for commercial production. A novel one-step process for producing carbon-coated Sn nanoparticles via spark plasma erosion (SPE) shows great promise as a simple, inexpensive production method. The SPE method, characterization of the resulting particles, and their high-capacity reversible electrochemical performance as anodes are described. With only a 10% addition of these novel SPE carbon-coated Sn particles, one anode composition demonstrated a reversible capacity of ~460 mAh/g, achieving the theoretical capacity of that particular electrode formulation. These SPE carbon-coated Sn nanoparticles are drop-in ready for present commercial lithium-ion anode processing and would provide a ~10% increase in the total capacity of current commercial lithium-ion cells.

Two electrolyte systems were used: 1.0 mol dm −3 (M) LiPF 6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) with 0.5 wt.% VC, and 1.0 M LiPF 6 in a mixture of EC and EMC with 1.0 wt.% VC and 10 wt.% FEC. These systems enabled the investigation of how FEC contributes to SEI stabilization and cycling stability. FEC promotes the formation of a LiF-rich SEI layer, which mitigates volume expansion and enhances capacity retention. Additionally, the accumulation of Li 2 CO 3 and Li 2 O in the SEI was found to increase interfacial resistance, as observed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Among the SiOx contents tested (0%, 3%, and 7.8%), the 3% SiOx content exhibited the best balance between SiOx and carbon nanotubes, resulting in improved SEI formation and enhanced electrochemical performance. These results offer insights into the optimization of electrolyte formulations for long-term cycling stability in SiOx-based lithium-ion batteries. Full article"

The study’s objective was to determine the impact of alloy composition on anode voltage stability and overall battery efficiency, particularly under extended cycling conditions. The research assessed the anodes’ voltage behaviour and internal resistance across magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI) 2 ) electrolyte formulations using a systematic setup involving cyclic voltammetry on the anode and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Mg-Al alloy demonstrated superior performance, with minimal voltage drop and lower resistance increase than the Mg-Ag alloy. The results showed that the Mg-Al alloy maintained over 85% energy efficiency after 100 cycles, significantly outperforming the Mg-Ag alloy, which exhibited increased degradation and efficiency reduction to approximately 80%. These findings confirm that incorporating aluminium into magnesium anodes stabilises the anode voltage and enhances the overall battery efficiency by mitigating degradation mechanisms. Consequently, the Mg-Al alloy is identified as an up-and-coming candidate for use in advanced battery technologies, offering energy density and cycle life improvements.

To address these challenges, this paper presents a robotic teleoperation system that leverages augmented reality (AR) and digital twin (DT) technologies to enable a human operator to work away from the danger zone. By integrating AR and DTs, the system not only provides a real-time visual representation of the robot’s status but also enables remote control via gesture recognition. A bidirectional communication framework established within the system synchronises the virtual robot with its physical counterpart in an AR environment, which enhances the operator’s understanding of both the robot and task statuses. In the event of anomalies, the operator can interact with the virtual robot through intuitive gestures based on information displayed on the AR interface, thereby improving decision-making efficiency and operational safety. The application of this system is demonstrated through a case study involving the disassembly of a busbar from an EoL EV battery. Furthermore, the performance of the system in terms of task completion time and operator workload was evaluated and compared with that of AR-based control methods without informational cues and ‘smartpad’ controls. The findings indicate that the proposed system reduces operation time and enhances user experience, delivering its broad application potential in complex industrial settings. Full article"

This paper presents a novel SOH estimation method that integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to improve prediction accuracy. Health Indicators (HIs) are first extracted from the battery’s charging curve, and correlation analysis is conducted on seven indirect HIs using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. To reduce dimensionality and eliminate redundancy, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied, with the principal component contributing over 94% used as a fusion HI to represent battery capacity degradation. PSO is then employed to optimize the weights ( ε ) between the input and hidden layers, as well as the hidden layer bias ( u ) in the ELM, treating these parameters as particles in the PSO framework. This optimization enhances the ELM’s performance, addressing instability issues in the standard algorithm. The proposed PSO-ELM model demonstrates superior accuracy in SOH prediction compared with ELM and other methods. Experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.0034, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 0.467%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.0043, providing a valuable reference for battery safety and reliability assessments.

Dense media separation (DMS) and froth flotation are the most often used processes for spodumene beneficiation. Magnetic separation (MS) and ore gravity concentration techniques in spodumene processing have also been considered. To produce battery-grade lithium salts, the beneficiated-concentrated spodumene must be treated further, with or without heat, in the presence of acidic or alkaline media. As a result, various pyro and hydrometallurgical techniques have been explored. Moreover, the process of extracting lithium from brine through precipitation, liquid–liquid extraction, and polymer inclusion membrane separation employing different organic, inorganic, and composite polymer sorbents has also been reviewed.

This paper introduces an innovative diagnostic method for early internal short circuits in LIB packs, utilizing dynamic time warping (DTW) applied to incremental capacity (IC). Initially, the terminal voltages of all cells within the LIB pack are ordered at any moment to determine the median terminal voltage, which is then used to generate the median IC curve. This curve acts as a reference benchmark that represents the condition of healthy cells in the pack. Subsequently, the DTW algorithm is utilized to measure the similarity between each cell’s IC curve and the median IC curve. Cells exhibiting similarity scores that exceed a specified threshold are identified as having MSC faults. Lastly, for the cells diagnosed with MSC conditions, a method for estimating short-circuit resistance (SR) based on variations in maximum charging voltage is devised to quantitatively evaluate the severity and evolution of the MSC. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed method effectively identifies MSC cells in the LIB pack and estimates their SRs without the necessity of a battery model, thereby affirming the method’s validity.

Therefore, to optimize battery efficiency, it is essential to understand how sputtering deposition conditions affect the quality and performance of LiMn 2 O 4 . This research examines how argon deposition pressure affects the stoichiometric characteristics and electrochemical performance of LiMn 2 O 4 . The study finds that changing argon deposition pressures, from a low of 5 mTorr to a high of 30 mTorr, results in the formation of different coating stoichiometries. At low argon deposition pressures, stoichiometric LiMn 2 O 4 cathode coatings formed, exhibiting the highest discharge capacity of 115 mAh/g. Conversely, at high argon deposition pressures, non-stoichiometric LiMn 2 O 4 with lithium deficiency was produced. These coatings exhibited diminished electrochemical behavior, achieving a discharge capacity of only 70 mAh/g at 5 mTorr. The lack of lithium resulted in a significant reduction in electrochemical performance, indicated by a high surface charge transfer resistance (R 2 = 48,529 Ω), which led to a low discharge capacity of 40 mAh/g.

In this study, we designed a novel LHCE featuring a solvent polarity gradient, designed to maximize both room- and low-temperature ion mobility. Extremely polar fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and low-freezing-point, −135 °C, non-polar nonaflurobutyl methyl ether (NONA) were supplemented by two intermediate solvents with incremental step-downs in polarity. The intermediate solvents consist of methyl (2,2,2-triflooethyl) carbonate (FEMC) and either diethylene carbonate (DEC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), or dibutyl carbonate (DBC). The four solvents were combined with 1 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (LiFSI) salt and were able to accommodate 37.5% diluent volume, resulting in ultra-low electrolyte freezing points below −120 °C. This contrasts with our previously investigated three-solvent LHCE, which only allowed for a 14% diluent volume and a −85 °C freezing point. Localized high salt concentrations were shown by less than 3% of FSI- anions being free in solution. The gradient LHCEs also showed room-temperature ionic conductivities above 10–3 S/cm and maintained high ion mobility below −40 °C. Lithium metal coin cells with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes featuring the gradient LHCEs, a reference three-solvent LHCE, and commercial ( 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 EC:DEC) electrolyte were constructed. All gradient LHCEs outperformed both the three-solvent and commercial electrolytes at all temperatures, with the DEC-based gradient LHCE showing the best performance of 159.7 mAh/g at 25 °C and 109.2 mAh/g at −50 °C, corresponding to a 68% capacity retention. These findings highlight the potential of LHCE systems to improve battery performance in low-temperature environments and propose a new gradient design strategy for electrolytes to yield advantages of both polar and weakly polar solvents.

Herein, this study developed a self-templating synthetic method to construct MoSe 2 nanosheets which were intercalated by ZnSe nanoparticles and were anchored on the in situ reduced graphene oxide layers. The thus-fabricated composites exhibited excellent Coulombic efficiency, a remarkable rate capability and an exceptionally long cycle life when being utilized as the anode in SIBs. Specifically, a reversible capacity of 265 mAh g −1 was achieved at 20 A g −1 , which could be maintained for 6400 cycles. At an ultra-high rate of 30.0 A g −1 , the anode retained a capacity of 235 mAh g −1 after 9500 cycles. Such a strong performance was attributed to its unique porous structure and synergistic interactions of multi-components.

It is typically present in the form of micrometer-sized LCO particles, which are surrounded by binders and conductive agents with a thickness of tens of microns. In order to determine the intrinsic Li transport parameters of pure crystalline LCO, it is necessary to measure the Li diffusivity at room temperature in sintered LCO pellets free of additives. The LCO sintered bulk material consists of interconnected, about 3 µm clusters, composed of grains of about 70 nanometers in size. The Li chemical and tracer diffusivities are determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT), while the latter ones are in the range between 10 −9 and 10 −28 m 2 s −1 , depending on the application of different relevant formulas and characteristic parameters. Consequently, it is essential to apply a classical non-electrochemical and Li selective method of tracer diffusion determination like 6 Li depth profiling and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for comparison. Li tracer diffusivities of about 10 −22 m 2 s −1 at room temperature are obtained by the extrapolation of the SIMS results from higher temperatures. This significantly narrows the range of reliable electrochemically determined Li tracer diffusivities to a more limited range, between 10 −21 and 10 −22 m 2 s −1 . Full article"

The results indicated significant correlations between electrochemical behavior, thickness changes, and gas evolution, revealing both the reversible and irreversible growth of constituents on particles and the electrode surface. The formation of the solid electrolyte interphase due to the degradation of electrolyte components, such as solvents or conductive salts, is identified as a key factor contributing to irreversible changes. The operando gas analysis highlighted the presence of decomposition intermediates and products, which are all linked to electrolyte degradation. Additionally, post-mortem gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry identified several compounds, confirming the presence of different decomposition pathways.

The effect of abusive mechanical loads arising from crash-related deformation or the possible movement of battery cells caused by operation-dependent thickness variations has so far never been investigated. Three quasi-static abuse tests for the anode and cathode electrode tabs were conducted with pouch cells at 100% SOC. Tensile tests on the anode, cathode and pouch foil were performed in order to explain differences between the anode and cathode in the abuse tests. The experiments revealed different failure mechanisms for the anode and cathode electrode tabs. The cathode failed at an average maximum load of 940.3 N through an external rupture of the electrode tab. The anode failed at an average maximum load of 868.9 N through a rupture of the single electrode sheets and the opening of the pouch foil. No thermal runaway occurred for either cathode or anode. The results of this study reveal a more critical failure behavior for the anode electrode tab, which can be addressed in the future by adding a predetermined breaking point and adapting the geometry of the anode electrode tab.

Unfortunately, the reported data are inconsistent between studies, which can be explained by weaknesses in experimental methodologies, the misinterpretation of data, or simply due to the comparison of datasets that build on different prerequisites. In the present work, the literature on gassing from battery components and battery cells is reported, with a focus on vent gas composition resulting from internal chemical processing in the battery and excluding studies where the gases are combusted after venting. The aim is to identify datasets of high quality that contribute to the advancement of our understanding of gas emissions from LIBs. Gas compositions from different stages in the gassing process are included, starting with the slow formation of gases during normal operation via mild thermal events to a thermal runaway (TR) with extensive gas production. Available published data are used to map gas quantity and composition from LIBs undergoing venting, with or without a TR, and to identify gaps in understanding and the need for further research.

LIBs present a significant challenge for state estimations due to their complex non-linear electrochemical behavior. Currently, commercial battery management systems (BMSs) commonly use easier-to-implement and faster equivalent circuit models (ECMs) than their counterpart continuum-scale physics-based models (PBMs). However, despite processing more mathematical and computational complexity, PBMs are attractive due to their higher accuracy, higher fidelity, and ease of integration with thermal and degradation models. Various reduced-order PBM battery models and their computationally efficient numerical schemes have been proposed in the literature. However, there is limited data on the performance and feasibility of these models in practical embedded and cloud systems using standard programming languages. This study compares the computational performance of a single particle model (SPM), an enhanced single particle model (ESPM), and a reduced-order pseudo-two-dimensional (ROM-P2D) model under various battery cycles on embedded and cloud systems using Python and C++. The results show that reduced-order solvers can achieve a 100-fold reduction in solution times compared to full-order models, while ESPM with electrolyte dynamics is about 1.5 times slower than SPM. Adding thermal models and Kalman filters increases solution times by approximately 20% and 100%, respectively. C++ provides at least a 10-fold speed increase over Python, varying by cycle steps. Although embedded systems take longer than cloud and personal computers, they can still run reduced-order models effectively in Python, making them suitable for embedded applications. Full article"

The energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors mainly includes electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. In addition to constructing multi-level pore structures to increase the specific surface area of electrode materials, defect engineering is essential for enhancing electrochemical active sites and achieving additional extrinsic pseudocapacitance. Therefore, developing a simple and efficient method for defect engineering is essential. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology enables precise control over thin film thickness at the atomic level through layer-by-layer deposition. This capability allows the intentional introduction of defects, such as vacancies, heteroatom doping, or misalignment, at specific sites within the material. The ALD process can regulate the defects in materials without altering the overall structure, thereby optimizing both the electrochemical and physical properties of the materials. Its self-limiting surface reaction mechanism also ensures that defects and doping sites are introduced uniformly across the material surface. This uniform defect distribution is particularly profitable for high surface area electrodes in supercapacitor applications, as it promotes consistent performance across the entire electrode. This review systematically summarizes the latest advancements in defect engineering via ALD technology in supercapacitors, including the enhancement of conductivity and the increase of active sites in supercapacitor electrode materials through ALD, thereby improving specific capacitance and energy density of the supercapacitor device.

Although particle filter (PF) techniques can handle nonlinear dynamics, they still face challenges, including particle degeneracy and loss of diversity, that reduce their ability to effectively model the nonlinear degradation mechanisms of batteries. To tackle these limitations, this paper presents a novel artificial intelligence-driven PF (AI-PF) technology for battery health modeling and prognosis. The main contributions of the AI-PF technique are as follows: (1) A novel dynamic sample degeneracy detection method is proposed to provide real-time assessment of particle weights so as to promptly identify degeneracy and improve computational efficiency.

This, in turn, calls for research into new battery materials, especially with regard to a battery’s main component: the electrolytes. Besides the demands associated with solid ionic conduction and appropriate electrochemical behaviour, considerable effort will be necessary to thoroughly reduce safety risks in terms of flammability, leakage, and thermal runaway. Consequently, completely new classes of electrolytes need to be developed that are compatible with energy storage systems. Despite the progress made in solid polymer electrolytes, such materials have suffered from limitations to their real-world application. Now, ionic liquids are considered a class of electrolytes with the most potential for the creation of more advanced and safer lithium–ion batteries. In recent decades, ILs have been widely explored as potential electrolytes in the search for new breakthroughs in the ESS field, such those associated with fuel cells, lithium–ion batteries, and supercapacitors. The present review will discuss ILs that present high ionic conductivity, a lower melting point below 100 °C, and which feature up to 5–6 V wide electrochemical potential windows vs. Li + /Li. Furthermore, ILs exhibit good thermal stability, non-flammability, and low volatility—all of which are attributes realized by appropriate cation–anion combinations.

One of the critical challenges with their use is the thermal runaway (TR), typically characterized by a sharp increase in internal pressure. A thorough understanding and accurate prediction of this behavior are crucial for improving the safety and reliability of these batteries. To achieve this, two new combined models were developed: one to simulate the thermal runaway and another to simulate the internal cell pressure. The thermal model tracks a chain of decomposition reactions that eventually lead to TR. At the same time, the pressure model simulates the proportional increase in pressure due to the evaporation of the electrolyte and the gases produced from the decomposition reactions. What sets this work apart is the validation of the pressure model through experimental data, specifically for prismatic lithium-ion cells using NMC chemistries with varying stoichiometries—NMC111 and NMC811. While the majority of the literature focuses on the simulation of temperature and pressure for cylindrical cells, studies addressing these aspects in prismatic cells are much less common. This article addresses this gap by conducting pressure validation experiments, which are hardly documented in the existing studies. Furthermore, the model’s accuracy and flexibility are tested through two experiments, conducted under diverse conditions to ensure robust and adaptive predictions of cell behavior during failure scenarios.

However, their performance degrades over time, and unexpected failures or discharges can lead to abrupt operational interruptions. Therefore, accurate prediction of the remaining useful life is essential to ensure device safety and reliability. Conventional RUL prediction methods typically rely on regression analysis, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to assess battery conditions such as charge/discharge cycles, voltage, temperature, and durability. Although effective, these approaches are constrained by their dependence on large amounts of labeled data and the necessity for complex feature engineering to capture battery physical characteristics. In this study, we propose an approach that employs deep transfer learning to address these limitations. By leveraging pretrained model weights, the proposed method significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of RUL prediction even under limited training data conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of external environmental factors and physical battery characteristics on RUL prediction precision, thereby contributing to a more robust and reliable prediction framework.

The method is based on fully charged battery characteristics, extracting key parameters such as voltage, temperature, and charging data collected during cycles. Validation was conducted under a temperature range of 10 °C to 30 °C and different charge–discharge current rates. Notably, temperature variations were primarily caused by seasonal changes, enabling the experiments to more realistically simulate the battery’s performance in real-world applications. By enhancing dynamic modeling capabilities and capturing long-term temporal associations, experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves highly accurate SOH estimation under various charging conditions, with low mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values and a coefficient of determination ( R 2 R 2 ) exceeding 97%, significantly improving prediction accuracy and efficiency.

Instead, a novel physics-informed learning procedure is used to combine the accuracy and flexibility of data-driven approaches with the extrapolation properties of physical models. The ageing model is parameterized in a two-stage process. In order to cover data ranges not present in operation, a laboratory ageing test campaign is used as a baseline. In the second stage, transfer learning is used to adjust a subset of the model parameters to fit data of different cells. This approach is not only applied to laboratory measurements but also validated by a series of capacity checkup tests performed with a fleet of electric vehicles. Results show the improved state-of-health (SOH) prediction of the proposed model parameterization method. Full article"

Facile Synthesis of S/Ti3C2TxMxene@Se Cathode for High-Sulfur-Loading Lithium–Sulfur Batteries,"Yupu Shi, Jianbin Xu, Xian Du, Yi Zhang, Fan Zhao, Ziwei Tang, Le Kang, Huiling Du",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10120430,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/430/pdf?version=1733220203,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/430,1,"Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are gaining much attention because they offer a much higher theoretical energy density compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. However, the cycling performance of LSBs with high sulfur mass loading is poor due to the shuttle effect, limiting the practical application of LSBs. In this work, a unique porous sulfur/Ti 3 C 2 T x Mxene@selenium (S/Ti 3 C 2 T x @Se) cathode of a LSB is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method to address these challenges. In this composite, Ti 3 C 2 T x forms a conductive framework and Se is tightly anchored on the framework. The Se inhibits the agglomeration of Ti 3 C 2 T x and prevents the collapse of Ti 3 C 2 T x . The S/Ti 3 C 2 T x @Se composite can adsorb lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and suppresses the shuttle effect and volume changes during cycling, improving the cycling stability of LSBs with high S loading. A high capacity of 812.2 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C with 5.0 mg cm −2 sulfur mass loading after 100 cycles is obtained. This work could inspire further research into high-performance S host materials for high-S-loading LSBs. Full article"
Synthesis and Characterization of Lithium Phosphate (Li3PO4) as a Solid Electrolyte,"Seybou Yacouba Zakariyaou, Hua Ye, Chongwen Jiang",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10120429,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/429/pdf?version=1733216508,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/429,3,"Due to its high thermal stability, environmental friendliness, and safety, lithium phosphate (Li 3 PO 4 ) is used as a solid electrolyte in battery applications, but it is usually used with dopants due to its lower ionic conductivity, which is required for ion transport. However, due to its stability and environmentally friendly aspect, lithium phosphate is still a hot topic among suitable energy materials that need further research to improve its electrochemical properties. In the current work, a novel synthesis of lithium phosphate was proposed from the raw materials lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ) and trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate (Na 3 PO 4 *12H 2 O) under suitable stoichiometric conditions using the co-precipitation method. In the set of synthesized samples, a single-phase β-Li 3 PO 4 (named LPO-4) with 99.7% purity and 93.49% yield was successfully prepared under appropriate stoichiometric conditions and pH 13 at 90 °C. The average particle size was 10 nm with a large surface area of 9.02 m 2 g −1 . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of LPO-4 revealed a conductivity of 7.1 × 10 −6 S.cm −1 at room temperature and 2.7 × 10 −5 S.cm −1 at 80 °C with a low activation energy of 0.38 eV. This performance is attributed to the morphology of the nanotubes and the smaller particle size, which enlarge the reaction interfaces and shorten the diffusion distance of lithium ions. The kinetic and thermodynamic key parameters showed that the β-Li 3 PO 4 exhibits thermal stability in the room temperature range up to 208.8 °C. All these property values indicate a promising application of lithium phosphate as a solid electrolyte in solid-state batteries and a new route for further investigation. Full article"
Synthesis of Three Ternary NiPP@PDA@DTA by Bridging Polydopamine and Its Flame Retardancy in Epoxy Resin,"Wenxin Zhu, Huiyu Chai, Yue Lu, Wang Zhan, Qinghong Kong",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10120428,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/428/pdf?version=1733203547,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/428,2,"Epoxy resin (EP) is an indispensable packaging material for batteries. Excellent thermal and flame-retardant properties of EP can ensure the safety performance of batteries. To solve the low-efficiency flame retardant of EP, nickel phenyl phosphate (NiPP) was synthesized and its surface was modified by polymerization of dopamine (PDA). [3-(hydroxy-phenyl-methylidene) imimine] triazole (DTA) was synthesized using 9,10-dihydro-9-oxygen-10-phosphophene-10-oxide (DOPO), 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The hybrid flame retardance NiPP@PDA@DTA was further synthesized by self-assembly between the negative charge on the surface of DTA and the positive charge on the surface of modified NiPP@PDA. Then, NiPP@PDA@DTA was added to EP to prepare EP/NiPP@PDA@DTA composites. The results showed that the incorporation of NiPP@PDA@DTA promoted the residual yield at high temperatures. Furthermore, EP composites showed excellent flame retardancy when NiPP@PDA@DTA was added. The EP/4 wt% NiPP@PDA@DTA composites can reach UL-94 V0 grade with a limit oxygen index (LOI) of 33.7%. While the heat release rate (HRR), total release rate (THR), CO 2 production (CO 2 P) and total smoke release (TSR) of EP/4 wt% NiPP@PDA@DTA composites decreased by 16.9%, 30.8%, 16.9% and 27.7% compared with those of EP. These improvements are mainly due to the excellent catalytic carbonization performance of Ni metal and P compounds. The azazole and phosphaphenanthrene groups have the effects of dilution quenching in the gas phase and cross-linking network blocking, as well as enhanced blowing-out effects. Full article"

By applying genetic algorithms (GA), the optimal configurations of PV generators, inverters/chargers, and batteries were determined, focusing on maximising the net present value (NPV). Both DC- and AC-coupled systems were explored. The performance of each configuration was simulated over a 25-year lifespan, considering varying pricing, solar resources, battery ageing, and PV degradation. Constraints included investment costs, capacity factors, and land use. A case study conducted in Wiesenthal, Germany, was followed by sensitivity analyses, revealing that a 75% reduction in battery costs is needed to make AC-coupled PV-plus-battery systems as profitable as PV-only systems. Further analysis shows that changes in electricity and FCR pricing as well as limits on FCR charging can significantly impact NPV. The study confirms that integrating arbitrage and FCR services can optimize system profitability. Full article"

Due to the uncertainty of the actual operating conditions of the vehicle, accurate estimation of the state-of-charge (SOC) of the power battery under multi-temperature scenarios plays an important role in guaranteeing the safety, economy, and reliability of electric vehicles. In this paper, a SOC estimation method based on the fusion of convolutional neural network-transformer (CNN-Transformer) and square root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF) for lithium-ion batteries in low-temperature scenarios is proposed. First, the CNN-Transformer base model is established. Then, the SRUKF algorithm is used to update the state of the Coulomb counting method results based on the base model results. Finally, ensemble learning theory is applied to estimate SOC in multi-temperature scenarios. Data is obtained from laboratory conditions at −20 °C, −7 °C, and 0 °C. The experimental results show that the SOC estimation method proposed in this study is stable in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) being between 2.69% and 4.22%. The proposed base model is also compared with the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to demonstrate its relative advantages. Full article"

To ensure computational efficiency, the heterogeneous cell structure is represented by homogenized material models. The required parameters are calibrated against several characteristic cell experiments. As a result, it is hardly possible to describe the behavior of the individual battery components, which reduces the level of detail. In this work, a new data-driven material model is presented, which not only provides the homogenized behavior but also information about the components. For this purpose, a representative volume element (RVE) of the cell structure is created. To determine the constitutive material models of the individual components, different characterization tests are performed. A novel method for carrying out single-layer compression tests is presented for the characterization in the thickness direction. The parameterized RVE is subjected to a large number of load cases using first-order homogenization theory. This data basis is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN), which is then implemented in commercial FEA software LS-DYNA R9.3.1 and is thus available as a material model. This novel data-driven material model not only provides the stress–strain relationship, but also outputs information about the condition of the components, such as the thinning of the separator. The material model is validated against two characteristic cell experiments. A three-point-bending test and an indentation test of the cell is used for this purpose. Finally, the influence of the architecture of the neural network on the computational effort is discussed. Full article"

Experimental Research on the Ignition Characteristics and Inhibition Strategy for Venting Emissions Mixture of Failure LiFePO4Battery,"Yan Wang, Zhaozhi Zhang, Ruiguang Yu, Yalun Li, Hewu Wang, Languang Lu, Xuning Feng, Minggao Ouyang",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10120423,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/423/pdf?version=1732956225,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/423,1,"When the concentration of a gas is below its lower flammable limit and the content of a liquid is below its minimum explosible concentration, their combined fuel mixture can be ignitable. The flammability characteristics and inhibition strategies for battery emission mixtures deserve further in-depth research attention. This article presents experimental research on the ignition characteristics and inhibition strategy for a venting emission mixture of a failure LiFePO 4 battery. By identifying the components of venting emissions, ignition experiments for gases, electrolyte mist, their combination fuels, and mixtures with additives are performed to determine the flammable parameters, including ignition sensitivity and severity. The hybrid combination of non-flammable venting gases and electrolyte mist has the potential to induce ignition. However, there still exists a non-ignition region, where the gas concentration ratio (m g ) is below 0.15 and the liquid concentration ratio (m l ) is below 0.1. A safety design principle can be proposed: increasing ignition temperature, prolonging ignition time, and reducing maximum pressure. Adhering to this principle, a non-flammable electrolyte consisting of 1 mol LiPF 6 in EC:DEC = 1:1 vol%, with FEC at 10% and VC at 1%, can be considered as an optimization strategy. In comparison to the original gas–liquid mixtures, the region where no ignition occurs becomes wider when both the m g is below 0.45 and the m l is below 0.3. The new two-phase mixture has an ignition temperature of 835 °C, which is, respectively, 50% higher than that of the original mixture. Overall, this experimental research demonstrates an innovative methodology for assessing the battery venting emission mixture safety while proposing a design principle for modifying non-flammable electrolyte functional materials. Consequently, these findings can contribute to formulating more suitable preventive and protective measures for commercial electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems’ thermal safety designs.

An experimental study was conducted on the non-linear stiffness of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2 and graphite electrodes as well as PE separators, harvested from large-format lithium-ion cells, using compression tests. The mechanical response of the components was determined for different operating conditions, including nominal stress levels, mechanical loading rates, and mechanical cycles. The presented work describes the test procedure, the experimental setup, and an objective evaluation method, allowing for a detailed summary of the observed mechanical behavior. A distinct nominal stress level and mechanical cycle dependency of the non-linear stiffnesses of the porous materials were found. However, no clear dependency on compression rate was observed. Based on the experimental data, a poroelastic mechanical model was utilized to predict the non-linear behavior of these porous materials under real mechanical operating scenarios with a normalized root-mean-squared error less than 5.5%. The results provide essential new insights into the mechanical behavior of porous electrodes and separators in lithium-ion cells under real operating conditions, enabling the accelerated development of high-performing and safe batteries for various applications.

However, the Zn anode faces challenges such as self-corrosion and dendrite formation, which limit its practical use in AZIB applications. In this work, a simple blade-coating method was used to successfully coat poly (vinylidene fluoride–hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF-HFP) on the Zn anode. The coated Zn anode (P-Zn) displayed a stable cycling performance (700 h) at 1 mA cm −2 current density in the symmetric cell. In addition, the full cell using MnO 2 as the cathode and P-Zn as the anode retained almost full capacity even after 1400 cycles at 2C, far outperforming the full cell using the unmodified Zn anode with only 50% capacity retention after 600 cycles. In situ optical observations of Zn deposition demonstrate that the special organic coating significantly enhances the uniform deposition of Zn 2+ , thus effectively mitigating corrosion and hydrogen evolution. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that the PVDF-HFP coating effectively narrows the adsorption energy gap between the P-Zn (002) and (101) planes, leading to the homogeneous deposition of Zn 2+ with fewer Zn dendrites. A simple and feasible strategy for designing ultra-stable AZIBs by coating an organic protective layer on the Zn surface is provided by this work. Full article"

To study the heat generation behavior of batteries under high-frequency ripple current excitation, this paper establishes a thermal model of LIBs, and different types of LIBs with low-temperature self-heating schemes are studied based on the established thermal model. Under the consideration of contact impedance, this paper tests the heat production of the battery under high-frequency ripple current and establishes an accurate thermal model of a lithium-ion battery under the excitation of high-frequency ripple current, and the absolute value of the maximum relative error between the measurement results and the thermal model is reduced from 181.4% to less than 20.6%, which makes the battery thermal model under high-frequency ripple current excitation more accurate. Then, based on the established thermal model, the calculation method of the minimum heating power required for different batteries under the same low-temperature self-heating conditions is proposed for batteries of different sizes, thermal properties, and internal resistances, and the preferred low-temperature self-heating scheme for different types of batteries is proposed by comparing the current multiplicity required for different high-frequency ripple current self-heating schemes.

Modeling and Analysis of Current Loading Effects on Electric Vehicle’s Lithium-Ion Batteries: A MATLAB-Based Model Approach,"Oladipo Folorunso, Rotimi Sadiku, Yskandar Hamam, Williams Kupolati",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10120417,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/417/pdf?version=1733216515,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/12/417,,"Beyond portable mobile devices, lithium-ion batteries play a crucial role in electric vehicle operations and stationary grid power generation. However, the aging of lithium-ion batteries, often accelerated by extreme temperatures and load current influences, requires thorough examination and solution. The high load current, cycling, temperature differential, and operational conditions are factors contributing to the reduction in capacity and shortened lifespan of lithium-ion batteries. In this study, a lithium-ion (LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 ) battery was modeled by using the MATLAB/Simulink model technique. In order to investigate the effect of resistance build-up in the batteries, the capacity of the batteries (old and new batteries) was analyzed over different usage periods: 360 cycles, 1000 cycles, and 2000 cycles. A cooling system was introduced to explicitly carry out an inductive analysis of the effect of temperature on the performances of the batteries. The effect of load current on the capacity of the battery was examined between 30 A and 100 A. The results showed that the available capacity of a battery is proportional to its usage rate. Generally, when the load current on the batteries (old and new batteries) was 30 A, the battery was ideally in good health even after 1000 cycles for a 2 h discharge time. In addition, the old battery, however, showed a capacity decrease to about 74.15% and 74.94% for scenarios 1 and 2 after 1000 cycles for a 2 h discharge time when the batteries were subjected to a 100 A discharge current. Amongst other factors, scenarios 1 and 2 can be differentiated by whether the battery pack discharges uniformly or non-uniformly, whether the individual cells operate under the same or different discharge cycles, and whether the batteries are with cooling or without a cooling system. The voltage and temperature differences between the old and new batteries, after 2000 cycles for the 100 A load current, are 4.0 V and 5.3 °C (scenario 2), respectively. Moreover, after 360 cycles at a 100 A discharge current, the temperature difference between the old and new batteries was 4.5 °C in scenario 1 and 2.3 °C in scenario 2. Based on the results obtained in this study, useful equations for proper calibration, voltage, and cooling switching time characteristics were proposed. Additionally, the study results indicated that at higher load currents, battery degradation became less affected by temperature differentials. The results of this study will aid in the adequate load optimization and thermal management of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicle applications. Full article"

However, the development of effective separator materials remains a significant challenge due to issues such as harmful dendrite growth on zinc (Zn) anodes and parasitic side reactions in aqueous electrolytes. To address this challenge, we synthesize a manganese-coordinated cellulose nanofibril (Mn-CNF)-based separator for high-performance AZIBs. This separator affords enhanced ion transport channel, a large number of hydroxyl groups, and exceptional mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 2.8 MPa and superior ionic conductivity of 5.14 mS·cm −1 . These attributes collectively enhance Zn-ion transport, minimize nucleation overpotential for Zn, and accelerate the Zn deposition kinetics, thus significantly outperforming the untreated CNF separators. Consequently, the Zn||MnO 2 battery with the Mn-CNF separator shows a marked improvement in the galvanostatic rate performance and cycling stability by effectively accelerating and optimizing Zn-ion transport. This study offers valuable insights into the development of efficient and reliable separators for advanced electrochemical energy storage technologies. Full article"

However, recycling methods targeting LFP batteries, especially production scraps, are still underdeveloped. This study investigated the extraction of iron phosphate and lithium from LFP production scraps using selective leaching, considering technical and economic aspects. Two leaching agents, sulfuric acid (0.25–0.5 M, 25 °C, 1 h, 50 g/L) and citric acid (0.25–0.5 M, 25 °C, 1 h, 70 g/L) were compared; hydrogen peroxide (3–6%vv.) was added to prevent iron and phosphorous solubilization. Sulfuric acid leached up to 98% of Li and recovered up to 98% of Fe and P in the solid residues. Citric acid leached 18–26% of Li and recovered 98% of Fe and P. Totally, 28% of Li was precipitated for sulfuric acid process, while recovery with citric acid did not produce enough precipitate for a characterization. Sulfur is the main impurity present in the precipitates. The total operative costs associated with reagents and energy consumption of the sulfuric acid route were below 3.00 €/kg. In conclusion, selective leaching provided a viable and economic method to recycle LFP production scraps, and it is worth further research to optimize Lithium recovery. Full article"

The broader adoption of LIBs hinges on advancements in their safety, cost-effectiveness, cycle life, energy density, and rate capability. While traditional LIBs already benefit from composite materials in components such as the cathode, anode, and separator, the integration of nanocomposite materials presents significant potential for enhancing these properties. Nanocomposites, including carbon–oxide, polymer–oxide, and silicon-based variants, are engineered to optimize key performance metrics, such as electrical conductivity, structural stability, capacity, and charging/discharging efficiency. Recent research has focused on refining these composites to overcome existing limitations in energy density and cycle life, thus paving the way for the next generation of LIB technologies. Despite these advancements, challenges related to high production costs and scalability remain substantial barriers to the widespread commercial deployment of nanocomposite-enhanced LIBs. Addressing these challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of these advanced materials, thereby driving significant improvements in the performance and practical applications of LIBs across various industries.

To achieve high-capacity flexible electrode materials, SnO 2 with high theoretical capacity has been introduced into electrodes and shows promising capacity. However, the electrodes are still confronted with major challenges in terms of inferior rate capability and cycling stability, which are caused by large volume changes of SnO 2 during the lithiation/delithiation process. Here, we adopt an adsorption assembly strategy to fabricate a flexible carbon fiber/SnO 2 @rGO electrode that effectively stabilizes the volume changes of SnO 2 and enhances the charge transport kinetics in electrodes. The sandwich-like structure endows the electrode’s high flexibility and succeeds in improving both rate capability and cycling stability.

The study incorporates a novel approach for solving the dynamic TOP, comparing two solution methodologies: a merging heuristic and a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The heuristic combines routes using calculated savings and a biased-randomized strategy, while the RL model leverages a transformer-based encoder–decoder architecture to sequentially construct solutions. We perform computational experiments on 50 problem instances, each subjected to 200 dynamic conditions, for a total of 10,000 problems solved. The results demonstrate that while the deterministic heuristic provides an upper bound for rewards, the RL model consistently yields robust solutions with lower variability under dynamic conditions. However, the dynamic heuristic, with a 20 s time limit for solving each instance, outperformed the RL model by 3.35 % on average. The study highlights the trade-offs between solution quality, computational resources, and time when dealing with dynamic environments in the TOP. Full article"

Thus, it is essential to detect lithium plating onset during the charging processes. Electrochemical impedance can reveal the dynamic electrode properties of the battery, which is promising for use in battery management systems for the online detection of lithium plating onset. In this article, the impedance at 1 Hz is measured during the over-discharge and fast discharge processes using lithium–graphite half-cells. For half-cells, the variation in graphite electrode potential vs. Li/Li + during discharging is directly recorded. An equivalent circuit model is proposed and adopted to estimate the real lithium plating reaction overpotential, which is deemed the thermodynamic indicator of lithium plating and is used as validation for the detection of lithium plating onset. Through the auxiliary validation of the estimation of lithium plating overpotential and the shape of incremental capacity curves, the relationship between impedance changes at specific frequency and the lithium plating onset is revealed.

Estimating the state of power (SOP) of a battery is necessary for battery safety control and preventing operation above acceptable limits. However, the SOP is influenced by coupled multiple parameters including the state of charge, state of health, and core temperature, which make it challenging to estimate comprehensively. Based on the electro-thermal model, this study proposes a multi-parameter coupled method for comprehensively estimating the SOP considering the core temperature. This method provides a robust approach to accurately assessing the SOP across varying core temperatures, states of charge (SoC), and voltage levels. The combination of maximum likelihood estimation, adaptive genetic algorithms for parameter identification, and the unscented Kalman filter for state estimation was found to enhance the accuracy and robustness of battery models. The results show that the battery core temperature and terminal voltage are important and the main limitation on the SOP, respectively.

This has significant implications as, by taking this into account, the testing voltage window of negative electrodes could be extended to allow gathering data for more complete discharges at higher rates. Moreover, from a modeling standpoint, it could also allow us to more accurately predict plating initiation potentials dynamically.

This study proposes a fast impedance spectrum construction method for lithium-ion batteries, where a multi-density clustering algorithm was designed to effectively extract the useful impedance after PRBS injection. According to the distribution properties of the measurement points by PRBS, a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) was used for processing the data of the lithium-ion battery’s impedance.

Fast-charging performance depends not only on materials but also on the battery’s inherent structure and the heterogeneity of the electrode reaction. Herein, we utilized advanced imaging techniques to explore how the internal structure of cylindrical batteries impacts macroscopic electrochemical performance. Our research unveiled the natural 3D structural non-uniformity of the electrodes, causing heterogeneity of electrode reaction. This non-uniformity of reaction exhibited a macro–meso–micro-scale feature in four dimensions: the exterior versus the interior of the electrode, the middle versus the sides of the cell, the inside versus the outside of the cell, and the surface versus the body of the electrode. Furthermore, the single-coated side of the anode demonstrated notably faster reaction than the double-coated sides, leading to the deposition of island-like lithium during fast charging.

Design and Development of Flow Fields with Multiple Inlets or Outlets in Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries,"Marco Cecchetti, Mirko Messaggi, Andrea Casalegno, Matteo Zago",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030108,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/108/pdf?version=1710842997,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/108,3,"In vanadium redox flow batteries, the flow field geometry plays a dramatic role on the distribution of the electrolyte and its design results from the trade-off between high battery performance and low pressure drops. In the literature, it was demonstrated that electrolyte permeation through the porous electrode is mainly regulated by pressure difference between adjacent channels, leading to the presence of under-the-rib fluxes. With the support of a 3D computational fluid dynamic model, this work presents two novel flow field geometries that are designed to tune the direction of the pressure gradients between channels in order to promote the under-the-rib fluxes mechanism. The first geometry is named Two Outlets and exploits the splitting of the electrolyte flow into two adjacent interdigitated layouts with the aim to give to the pressure gradient a more transverse direction with respect to the channels, raising the intensity of under-the-rib fluxes and making their distribution more uniform throughout the electrode area. The second geometry is named Four Inlets and presents four inlets located at the corners of the distributor, with an interdigitated-like layout radially oriented from each inlet to one single central outlet, with the concept of reducing the heterogeneity of the flow velocity within the electrode. Subsequently, flow fields performance is verified experimentally adopting a segmented hardware in symmetric cell configuration with positive electrolyte, which permits the measurement of local current distribution and local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Compared to a conventional interdigitated geometry, both the developed configurations permit a significant decrease in the pressure drops without any reduction in battery performance. In the Four Inlets flow field the pressure drop reduction is more evident (up to 50%) due to the lower electrolyte velocities in the feeding channels, while the Two Outlets configuration guarantees a more homogeneous current density distribution.

Leveraging the Toyota Research Institute Dataset, consisting of 124 lithium-ion batteries cycled to failure and encompassing key metrics such as capacity, temperature, resistance, and discharge time, our analysis substantially improves RUL prediction accuracy. Notably, the convolutional long short-term memory deep neural network (CLDNN) model and the transformer LSTM (temporal transformer) model have emerged as standout remaining useful life (RUL) predictors. The CLDNN model, in particular, achieved a remarkable mean absolute error (MAE) of 84.012 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 25.676. Similarly, the temporal transformer model exhibited a notable performance, with an MAE of 85.134 and a MAPE of 28.7932.

Contact resistance properties are characterized via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on the example of LMFP cathodes. The EIS results are compared to a two-point probe as well as to the results obtained using a novel commercial 46-point probe system. The magnitude and ratio of contact resistance and compound electronic resistance for LMFP- and NCM-based cathodes are discussed on the basis of the 46-point probe measurement results. The results show that the 46-point probe yields significantly lower resistance values than those in EIS studies. Further results show that electronic resistance values in cathodes can vary over several orders of magnitude.

Over time, their significance has grown exponentially with the advent of features such as “Start & Stop” systems, micro hybridization, and kinetic energy regeneration. This trend culminated in the emergence of hybrid and electric vehicles, where batteries are the energy source of the electric traction motors. The evolution of storage for vehicles has been driven by the need for larger autonomy, a higher number of cycles, lower self-discharge rates, enhanced performance in extreme temperatures, and greater electrical power extraction capacity. As these technologies have advanced, so have they the methods for their disposal, recovery, and recycling. However, one critical aspect often overlooked is the potential for battery reuse once they reach the end of their useful life. For each battery technology, specific regeneration methods have been developed, aiming to restore the battery to its initial performance state or something very close to it. This focus on regeneration holds significant economic implications, particularly for vehicles where batteries represent a substantial share of the overall cost, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of battery technologies employed in vehicles from their inception to the present day. Special attention is given to identifying common failures within these technologies.

Electrodes with a ternary binder composition (CMC:PAA:SBR) have the best performance with bare Al current collectors, attaining a specific capacity of 150 mAh g −1 at 1C. Using carbon-coated Al current collectors results in improved performance for both water- and NMP-based electrodes. This is further accentuated for Na-Alg and CMC:PAA binder compositions.

The performance of a lithium-ion battery is, to a large extent, determined by the microstructure (i.e., layer thickness and porosity) of its electrodes. Tailoring the microstructure to a specific application is a crucial process in battery development. However, unravelling the complex correlations between microstructure and rate performance using either experiments or simulations is time-consuming and costly. Our approach provides a swift method for predicting the rate capability of battery electrodes by using machine learning on microstructural images of electrode cross-sections. We train multiple models in order to predict the specific capacity based on the batteries’ microstructure and investigate the decisive parts of the microstructure through the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. Our study shows that even comparably small neural network architectures are capable of providing state-of-the-art prediction results. In addition to this, our XAI studies demonstrate that the models are using understandable human features while ignoring present artefacts. Full article"
Low-Computational Model to Predict Individual Temperatures of Cells within Battery Modules,"Ali Abbas, Nassim Rizoug, Rochdi Trigui, Eduardo Redondo-Iglesias, Serge Pelissier",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030098,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/98/pdf?version=1710236129,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/98,4,"Predicting the operating temperature of lithium-ion battery during different cycles is important when it comes to the safety and efficiency of electric vehicles. In this regard, it is vital to adopt a suitable modeling approach to analyze the thermal performance of a battery. In this paper, the temperature of lithium-ion NMC pouch battery has been investigated. A new formulation of lumped model based on the thermal resistance network is proposed. Unlike previous models that treated the battery as a single entity, the proposed model introduces a more detailed analysis by incorporating thermal interactions between individual cells and tabs within a single cell scenario, while also considering interactions between cells and insulators or gaps, located between the cells, within the module case. This enhancement allows for the precise prediction of temperature variations across different cells implemented within the battery module. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction, a three-dimensional finite element model was adopted as a reference. The study was performed first on a single cell, then on modules composed of several cells connected in series, during different operating conditions. A comprehensive comparison between both models was conducted. The analysis focused on two main aspects, the accuracy of temperature predictions and the computational time required. Notably, the developed lumped model showed a significant capability to estimate cell temperatures within the modules. The thermal results revealed close agreement with the values predicted by the finite element model, while needing significantly lower computational time. For instance, while the finite element model took almost 21 h to predict the battery temperature during consecutive charge/discharge cycles of a 10-cell module, the developed lumped model predicted the temperature within seconds, with a maximum difference of 0.42 °C.

Sodium Citrate Electrolyte Additive to Improve Zinc Anode Behavior in Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries,"Xin Liu, Liang Yue, Weixu Dong, Yifan Qu, Xianzhong Sun, Lifeng Chen",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030097,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/97/pdf?version=1710138854,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/97,20,"Despite features of cost-effectiveness, high safety, and superior capacity, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have issues of uncontrolled dendritic cell failure and poor Zn utilization, resulting in inferior cycling reversibility. Herein, the environmentally friendly and naturally abundant sodium citrate (SC) was adopted as a dual-functional additive for ZnSO 4 -based (ZSO) electrolytes. Owing to the abundant hydrogen-bond donors and hydrogen-bond acceptors of SC, the Zn 2+ -solvation shell is interrupted to facilitate Zn desolvation, resulting in inhibited corrosion reactions. Additionally, sodium ions (Na + ) from the SC additive with a lower effective reduction potential than that of zinc ions (Zn 2+ ) form an electrostatic shield inhibiting the formation of initial surface protuberances and subsequent Zn dendrite growth. This assists in the Zn three-dimensional (3D) diffusion and deposition, thereby effectively enhancing cycling stability. Specifically, a long cycling lifespan (more than 760 h) of the Zn//Zn symmetric cell is achieved with a 2 M ZSO-1.0 SC electrolyte at a current density of 1 mA cm −2 . When coupled with the NaV 3 O 8 ·1.5 H 2 O (NVO) cathode, the full battery containing SC additive exhibited a capacity retention rate (40.0%) and a cycling life of 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g −1 compared with that of pure ZnSO 4 electrolyte (23.8%). This work provides a protocol for selecting an environmentally friendly and naturally abundant dual-functional electrolyte additive to achieve solvation shell regulation and Zn anode protection for the practical large-scale application of ZIBs.

These equimolar multielemental compounds have demonstrated increased charge capacities, enhanced ionic conductivities, and a prolonged cycle life, attributed to their structural stability. In the anode, transitioning from the traditional graphite (372 mAh g −1 ) to an HEM anode can increase capacity and enhance cycling stability. For cathodes, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) can be replaced with new cathodes made from HEMs, leading to greater energy storage. HEMs play a significant role in electrolytes, where they can be utilized as solid electrolytes, such as in ceramics and polymers, or as new high-entropy liquid electrolytes, resulting in longer cycling life, higher ionic conductivities, and stability over wide temperature ranges. The incorporation of HEMs in metal–air batteries offers methods to mitigate the formation of unwanted byproducts, such as Zn(OH) 4 and Li 2 CO 3 , when used with atmospheric air, resulting in improved cycling life and electrochemical stability. This review examines the basic characteristics of HEMs, with a focus on the various applications of HEMs for use as different components in lithium-ion batteries. The electrochemical performance of these materials is examined, highlighting improvements such as specific capacity, stability, and a longer cycle life. The utilization of HEMs in new anodes, cathodes, separators, and electrolytes offers a promising path towards future energy storage solutions with higher energy densities, improved safety, and a longer cycling life.

Effect of Mixing Intensity on Electrochemical Performance of Oxide/Sulfide Composite Electrolytes,"Jessica Gerstenberg, Dominik Steckermeier, Arno Kwade, Peter Michalowski",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030095,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/95/pdf?version=1709793470,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/95,5,"Despite the variety of solid electrolytes available, no single solid electrolyte has been found that meets all the requirements of the successor technology of lithium-ion batteries in an optimum way. However, composite hybrid electrolytes that combine the desired properties such as high ionic conductivity or stability against lithium are promising. The addition of conductive oxide fillers to sulfide solid electrolytes has been reported to increase ionic conductivity and improve stability relative to the individual electrolytes, but the influence of the mixing process to create composite electrolytes has not been investigated. Here, we investigate Li 3 PS 4 (LPS) and Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) composite electrolytes using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and distribution of relaxation times. The distinction between sulfide bulk and grain boundary polarization processes is possible with the methods used at temperatures below 10 °C. We propose lithium transport through the space-charge layer within the sulfide electrolyte, which increases the conductivity. With increasing mixing intensities in a high-energy ball mill, we show an overlay of the enhanced lithium-ion transport with the structural change of the sulfide matrix component, which increases the ionic conductivity of LPS from 4.1 × 10 −5 S cm −1 to 1.7 × 10 −4 S cm −1 .

One of the most promising is Zn-O 2 batteries because they provide the second biggest theoretical energy density, with relevant safety and a cycle of life long enough to be fitted for massive use. However, their industrial use is hindered by a series of obstacles, such as a fast reduction in the energy density after the initial charge and discharge cycles and a limited cathode efficiency or an elevated overpotential between discharge and charge. This work is focused on the synthesis of titanium compounds as catalyzers for the cathode of a Zn-O 2 aqueous battery and their characterization. The results have shown a surface area of 350 m 2 /g after the elimination of the organic templates during heat treatment at 500 °C in air. Different thermal treatments were performed, tuning different parameters, such as intermediate treatment at 500 °C or the atmosphere used and the final temperature. Surface areas remain high for samples without an intermediate temperature step of 500 °C. Raman spectroscopy studies confirmed the nitridation of samples. SEM and XRD showed macro–meso-porosity and the presence of nitrogen, and the electrochemical evaluation confirmed the catalytic properties of this material in oxygen reaction reduction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) analysis and Zn-O 2 battery tests.

Nevertheless, the replacement of low-sustainable nickel with more abundant iron would be desirable. Although it can be achieved in P2-Na 2/3 Ni 2/9 Fe 2/9 Mn 5/9 O 2 , its performance still requires further improvement. Many imaginative strategies such as surface modification have been proposed to minimize undesirable interactions at the cathode–electrolyte interface while facilitating sodium insertion in different materials. Here, we examine four different approaches based on the use of the electron-conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as an additive: (i) electrochemical in situ polymerization of the monomer, (ii) manual mixing with the active material, (iii) coating the current collector, and (iv) a combination of the latter two methods. As compared with pristine layered oxide, the electrochemical performance shows a particularly effective way of increasing cycling stability by using electropolymerization. Contrarily, the mixtures show less improvement, probably due to the heterogeneous distribution of oxide and polymer in the samples. In contrast with less conductive polyanionic cathode materials such as phosphates, the beneficial effects of PEDOT on oxide cathodes are not as much in rate performance as in inhibiting cycling degradation, due to the compactness of the electrodes without loss of electrical contact between active particles.

The literature data were associated with three macro-areas—Asia, Europe, and the USA—considering common LIBs (nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP)). The GWP (kgCO 2eq /kg) values were higher for use compared to raw material mining, production, and end of life management for hydrometallurgy or pyrometallurgy. Considering the significant values associated with the use phase and the frequent application of secondary data, this study also calculated the GWP of LIBs applied in public urban buses in Turin, Italy. The 2021 fleet (53% diesel, 36% natural gas, and 11% electric buses) was compared to scenarios with increasing shares of hybrid/electric. The largest reduction in CO 2eq emissions (−41%) corresponded to a fleet with 64% electric buses. In conclusion, this review highlighted the bottlenecks of the existing literature on the GWP of the LIB lifecycle, a lack of data for specific macro-areas for production and use, and the key role of public transportation in decarbonizing urban areas.

However, as the nickel content increases in ternary layered materials, their thermal stability noticeably decreases. It is of paramount importance to explore the characteristics of thermal runaway for lithium-ion batteries. In this study, two high-nickel LiNi 0.9 Co 0.05 Mn 0.05 O 2 batteries were laterally heated to thermal runaway in a sealed chamber filled with nitrogen to investigate the thermal characteristics and gas compositions. The temperature of the battery tabs was measured, revealing that both batteries were in a critical state of thermal runaway near 120 degrees Celsius. A quantitative analysis method was employed during the eruption process, dividing it into three stages: ultra-fast, fast, and slow; the corresponding durations for the two batteries were 3, 2, 27 s and 3, 3, 26 s. By comparing the changes in chamber pressure, it was observed that both batteries exhibited a similar continuous venting duration of 32 s. However, the pressure fluctuation ranges of the two samples were 99.5 and 68.2 kPa·m·s −1 . Compared to the other sample, the 211 Ah sample exhibited larger chamber pressure fluctuations and reached higher peak pressures, indicating a higher risk of explosion. In the experimental phenomenon captured by a high-speed camera, it took only 1 s for the sample to transition from the opening of the safety valve to filling the experimental chamber with smoke. The battery with higher energy density exhibited more intense eruption during thermal runaway, resulting in more severe mass loss. The mass loss of the two samples is 73% and 64.87%. The electrolyte also reacted more completely, resulting in a reduced number of measured exhaust components. The main components of gaseous ejections are CO, CO 2 , H 2 , C 2 H 4 , and CH 4 . For the 211 Ah battery, the vented gases were mainly composed of CO (41.3%), CO 2 (24.8%), H 2 (21%), C 2 H 4 (7.4%) and CH 4 (3.9%), while those for the other 256 Ah battery were mainly CO (30.6%), CO 2 (28.5%), H 2 (21.7%), C 2 H 4 (12.4%) and CH 4 (5.8%). Comparatively, the higher-capacity battery produced more gases. The gas volumes, converted to standard conditions (0 °C, 101 kPa) and normalized, resulted in 1.985 L/Ah and 2.182 L/Ah, respectively. The results provide valuable guidance for the protection of large-capacity, high-energy-density battery systems.

This work comprehensively assesses the limitations and challenges of state-of-the-art, implemented direct recycling methods for spent LIB cathode and anode material treatment. The introduced approaches include solid-state sintering, electrochemical relithiation in organic and aqueous electrolytes, and ionothermal, solution, and eutectic relithiation methods. Since most direct recycling techniques are still being developed and implemented primarily on a laboratory scale, this review identifies and discusses potential areas for optimization to facilitate forthcoming large-scale industrial implementation.

Film Thickness Effect in Restructuring NiO into LiNiO2Anode for Highly Stable Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Thang Phan Nguyen, Il Tae Kim",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030080,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/80/pdf?version=1709043448,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/80,,"The long-term stability of energy-storage devices for green energy has received significant attention. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on materials such as metal oxides, Si, Sb, and Sn have shown superior energy density and stability owing to their intrinsic properties and the support of conductive carbon, graphene, or graphene oxides. Abnormal capacities have been recorded for some transition metal oxides, such as NiO, Fe 2 O 3 , and MnO/Mn 3 O 4 . Recently, the restructuring of NiO into LiNiO 2 anode materials has yielded an ultrastable anode for LIBs. Herein, the effect of the thin film thickness on the restructuring of the NiO anode was investigated. Different electrode thicknesses required different numbers of cycles for restructuring, resulting in significant changes in the reconstituted cells. NiO thicknesses greater than 39 μm reduced the capacity to 570 mAh g −1 . The results revealed the limitation of the layered thickness owing to the low diffusion efficiency of Li ions in the thick layers, resulting in non-uniformity of the restructured LiNiO 2 . The NiO anode with a thickness of approximately 20 μm required only 220 cycles to be restructured at 0.5 A g −1 , while maintaining a high-rate performance for over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 , and a high capacity of 1000 mAh g −1 .

A Review of the Technical Challenges and Solutions in Maximising the Potential Use of Second Life Batteries from Electric Vehicles,"Farhad Salek, Shahaboddin Resalati, Meisam Babaie, Paul Henshall, Denise Morrey, Lei Yao",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030079,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/79/pdf?version=1709540167,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/79,20,"The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the roads has led to a rise in the number of batteries reaching the end of their first life. Such batteries, however, still have a capacity of 75–80% remaining, creating an opportunity for a second life in less power-intensive applications. Utilising these second-life batteries (SLBs) requires specific preparation, including grading the batteries based on their State of Health (SoH); repackaging, considering the end-use requirements; and the development of an accurate battery-management system (BMS) based on validated theoretical models. In this paper, we conduct a technical review of mathematical modelling and experimental analyses of SLBs to address existing challenges in BMS development. Our review reveals that most of the recent research focuses on environmental and economic aspects rather than technical challenges. The review suggests the use of equivalent-circuit models with 2RCs and 3RCs, which exhibit good accuracy for estimating the performance of lithium-ion batteries during their second life. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests provide valuable information about the SLBs’ degradation history and conditions. For addressing calendar-ageing mechanisms, electrochemical models are suggested over empirical models due to their effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, generating cycle-ageing test profiles based on real application scenarios using synthetic load data is recommended for reliable predictions. Artificial intelligence algorithms show promise in predicting SLB cycle-ageing fading parameters, offering significant time-saving benefits for lab testing. Our study emphasises the importance of focusing on technical challenges to facilitate the effective utilisation of SLBs in stationary applications, such as building energy-storage systems and EV charging stations.

To collect the most accurate temperature data of LIBs, previous studies used thermocouples in the cell and proved them to be technically viable. However, the cost and scale-up limitations of this method restricted its use in many applications, hindering its mass adoption. This work developed a low-cost and scalable screen-printed carbon black thermocouple to study its applicability for the thermal monitoring of LIB. Given the appropriate manufacturing parameters, it was found that thermal sensors may be printed on the electrodes, installed on a pouch cell, and once calibrated, operate with excellent sensitivity. However, to reliably use a printed carbon black thermocouple in operando of a pouch cell, its chemical resistance against electrolytes was found to require further development. Full article"
A Novel Long Short-Term Memory Approach for Online State-of-Health Identification in Lithium-Ion Battery Cells,"Mike Kopp, Alexander Fill, Marco Ströbel, Kai Peter Birke",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030077,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/77/pdf?version=1708960413,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/77,3,"Revolutionary and cost-effective state estimation techniques are crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology, especially in mobile applications. Accurate prediction of battery state-of-health (SoH) enhances state-of-charge estimation while providing valuable insights into performance, second-life utility, and safety. While recent machine learning developments show promise in SoH estimation, this paper addresses two challenges. First, many existing approaches depend on predefined charge/discharge cycles with constant current/constant voltage profiles, which limits their suitability for real-world scenarios. Second, pure time series forecasting methods require prior knowledge of the battery’s lifespan in order to formulate predictions within the time series. Our novel hybrid approach overcomes these limitations by classifying the current aging state of the cell rather than tracking the SoH. This is accomplished by analyzing current pulses filtered from authentic drive cycles. Our innovative solution employs a Long Short-Term Memory-based neural network for SoH prediction based on residual capacity, making it well suited for online electric vehicle applications. By overcoming these challenges, our hybrid approach emerges as a reliable alternative for precise SoH estimation in electric vehicle batteries, marking a significant advancement in machine learning-based SoH estimation.

Stochastic Control of Battery Energy Storage System with Hybrid Dynamics,"Richard Žilka, Ondrej Lipták, Martin Klaučo",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030075,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/75/pdf?version=1708675386,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/75,,"This paper addresses the control of load demand and power in a battery energy storage system (BESS) with Boolean-type constraints. It employs model predictive control (MPC) tailored for such systems. However, conventional MPC encounters computational challenges in practical applications, including battery storage control, and requires dedicated, mostly licensed solvers. To mitigate this, a solver-free yet efficient, suboptimal method is proposed. This approach involves generating randomized control sequences and assessing their feasibility to ensure adherence to constraints. The sequence with the best performance index is then selected, prioritizing feasibility and safety over optimality. Although this chosen sequence may not match the exact MPC solution in terms of optimality, it guarantees safe operation. The optimal control problem for the BESS is outlined, encompassing constraints on the state of charge, power limits, and charge/discharge modes. Three distinct scenarios evaluate the proposed method. The first prioritizes minimizing computational time, yielding a feasible solution significantly faster than the optimal approach. The second scenario strikes a balance between computational efficiency and suboptimality. The third scenario aims to minimize suboptimality while accepting longer computation times. This method’s adaptability to the user’s requirements in various scenarios and solver-free evaluation underscores its potential advantages in environments marked by stringent computational demands, a characteristic often found in BESS control applications.

One-Time Prediction of Battery Capacity Fade Curve under Multiple Fast Charging Strategies,"Xiaoming Han, Zhentao Dai, Mifeng Ren, Jing Cui, Yunfeng Shi",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030074,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/74/pdf?version=1708592176,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/74,,"Using different fast charging strategies for lithium-ion batteries can affect the degradation rate of the batteries. In this case, predicting the capacity fade curve can facilitate the application of new batteries. Considering the impact of fast charging strategies on battery aging, a battery capacity degradation trajectory prediction method based on the TM-Seq2Seq (Trend Matching—Sequence-to-Sequence) model is proposed. This method uses data from the first 100 cycles to predict the future capacity fade curve and EOL (end of life) in one-time. First, features are extracted from the discharge voltage-capacity curve. Secondly, a sequence-to-sequence model based on CNN, SE-net, and GRU is designed. Finally, a trend matching loss function is designed based on the common characteristics of capacity fade curves to constrain the encoding features of the sequence-to-sequence model, facilitating the learning of the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs. TM-Seq2Seq model is verified on a public dataset with 132 battery cells and multiple fast charging strategies. The experimental results indicate that, compared to other popular models, the TM-Seq2Seq model has lower prediction errors. Full article"

However, lithium-based ionic conductors suffer from safety concerns, and the limited availability of lithium in the Earth’s crust is at the root of the need to consider alternative metal ions. Notably, sodium stands out as the sixth most-prevalent element; therefore, when considering mineral reserves, it as a very attractive candidate as an alternative to the status quo. Even if the specific energy and energy density of sodium are indeed inferior with respect to those of lithium, there is substantial economic appeal in promoting the use of the former metal in stationary energy storage applications. For these reasons, the promise of sodium is likely to extend to other commercial applications, including portable electronics, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles. Widely used organic liquid electrolytes, regardless of their chosen metal cation, are disadvantageous due to leakage, evaporation, and high flammability. Polymer electrolytes are acknowledged as the most effective candidates to overcome these obstacles and facilitate the advancement of next-generation energy storage applications. In this contribution, an in-depth and comprehensive review of sodium polymer electrolytes for primary and secondary batteries is proposed. The overarching goal was to gain insight into successful synthetic strategies and their implications for conduction parameters and conductivity mechanisms. The focus lies on solid, gel, and composite polymer electrolytes. Our hope is that the proposed discussion will be helpful to all operators in the field, whether in tackling fundamental research problems or resolving issues of practical significance. Full article"
"Influence of Pressure, Temperature and Discharge Rate on the Electrical Performances of a Commercial Pouch Li-Ion Battery","Luigi Aiello, Peter Ruchti, Simon Vitzthum, Federico Coren",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10030072,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/72/pdf?version=1709112919,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/3/72,12,"In this study, the performances of a pouch Li-ion battery (LIB) with respect to temperature, pressure and discharge-rate variation are measured. A sensitivity study has been conducted with three temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, 45 °C), four pressures (0.2 MPa, 0.5 MPa, 0.8 MPa, 1.2 MPa) and three electrical discharge rates (0.5 C, 1.5 C, 3.0 C). Electrochemical processes and overall efficiency are significantly affected by temperature and pressure, influencing capacity and charge–discharge rates. In previous studies, temperature and pressure were not controlled simultaneously due to technological limitations. A novel test bench was developed to investigate these influences by controlling the surface temperature and mechanical pressure on a pouch LIB during electrical charging and discharging. This test rig permits an accurate assessment of mechanical, thermal and electrical parameters, while decoupling thermal and mechanical influences during electrical operation. The results of the study confirm what has been found in the literature: an increase in pressure leads to a decrease in performance, while an increase in temperature leads to an increase in performance. However, the extent to which the pressure impacts performance is determined by the temperature and the applied electrical discharge rate. At 5 °C and 0.5 C, an increase in pressure from 0.2 MPa to 1.2 MPa results in a 5.84% decrease in discharged capacity. At 45 °C the discharge capacity decreases by 2.17%. Regarding the impact of the temperature, at discharge rate of 0.5 C, with an applied pressure of 0.2 MPa, an increase in temperature from 25 °C to 45 °C results in an increase of 4.27% in discharged capacity. The impact on performance varies significantly at different C-rates. Under the same pressure (0.2 MPa) and temperature variation (from 25 °C to 45 °C), increasing the electrical discharge rate to 1.5 C results in a 43.04% increase in discharged capacity. The interplay between temperature, pressure and C-rate has a significant, non-linear impact on performance. This suggests that the characterisation of an LIB would require the active control of both temperature and pressure during electrical operation. Full article"

However, their health management problems remain unsolved in actual application. Therefore, this paper focuses on battery capacity as the key health indicator and proposes a data-driven method for capacity prediction. Specifically, this method mainly utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction from raw data and combines it with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) algorithm to realize the capacity prediction of LIBs. In addition, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to optimize the hyper-parameters of the neural network to further improve the prediction performance of original network structures. Ultimately, experiments with a public dataset of batteries are carried out to verify and evaluate the effectiveness of capacity prediction under two temperature conditions. The results show that the SSA-CNN-BiLSTM framework for capacity prediction of LIBs has higher accuracy compared with other original network structures during the multi-battery cycle experiments.

However, their development is significantly impeded by the presence of undesired zinc dendrites, which greatly reduce their cycle life. It is well-received that surface passivation by introducing foreign metals represents a compelling measure to enhance the stability of Zn anodes. Nevertheless, the vast potential of effecting concerted interplay between multiple metal elements for enhanced overall performance in Zn ion batteries remains elusive, due to the overwhelming challenge in creating uniform textures from hetero-units and understanding the mechanism underlying the synergistic performance gain. In this work, an innovative bimetallic overlaying strategy is proposed that renders possible the synergy between AgZn 3 and CuZn 5 in effecting uniform Zn deposition in a laterally confined and compact manner. The seeded growth of Zn on the bimetal-modulated interface effectively reduces the nucleation potential barrier, yielding a low nucleation overpotential (25 mV). In full cell testing with a commercial MnO 2 applied as the cathode, superb cycling stability, surpassing the results reported in previous works, is achieved. The cell delivers an outstanding remaining capacity of 215 mA h g −1 after 300 cycles with almost no capacity degradation observed. The simple and highly efficient bimetal design, which synergizes the strengths of distinct metals, has the potential to drive innovations in the development of multicomponent aqueous Zn batteries with exceptional performance.

The capabilities of BESSs to store a consistent amount of energy and to behave as a load by releasing it ensures an essential source of flexibility to the power system. Nevertheless, BESSs have some drawbacks that pose limitations to their utilization. Indeed, effectively managing the stored and released energy is crucial, considering the degradation of performance associated with these systems over time. The substantial capital expenditure (CAPEX) required to install these systems represents a current constraint, impeding their broader adoption. This work evaluates a techno-economic analysis of a 2MW/2MWh BESS providing multiple services, namely participating in capacity and balance markets. The analysis is based on a BESS model implemented in SIMULINK, adopting online data gathered from a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery facility. The model evaluates the auxiliary power consumption, state-of-charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), and the round-trip efficiency (RTE) of the overall system. The analysis is based on three price profiles: 2019 (Business-As-Usual), 2020 (COVID-19), and 2022 (Gas Crisis). Furthermore, this work conducts a case study to analyze the behavior of the BESS. It entails a sensitivity analysis, specifically evaluating the influence of CAPEX and upward bid price on the economic viability of the project. The results show a strong relation between the CAPEX variation and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project. Full article"

When dispatching shifts from stable single conditions to intricate coupled conditions, this distribution strategy inevitably results in increased inconsistency and hastened system aging. This paper presents a novel differentiated power distribution strategy comprising three control variables: the rotation status, and the operating boundaries for both depth of discharge (DOD) and C-rates (C) within a control period. The proposed strategy integrates an aging cost prediction model developed to express the mapping relationship between these control variables and aging costs. Additionally, it incorporates the multi-colony particle swarm optimization (Mc-PSO) algorithm into the optimization model to minimize aging costs. The aging cost prediction model consists of three functions: predicting health features (HFs) based on the cumulative charge/discharge throughput quantity and operating boundaries, characterizing HFs as comprehensive scores, and calculating aging costs using both comprehensive scores and residual equipment value. Further, we elaborated on the engineering application process for the proposed control strategy. In the simulation scenarios, this strategy prolonged the service life by 14.62%, reduced the overall aging cost by 6.61%, and improved module consistency by 21.98%, compared with the traditional equalized distribution strategy. In summary, the proposed strategy proves effective in elongating service life, reducing overall aging costs, and increasing the benefit of energy storage systems in particular application scenarios.

Abuse models can help to undestand propagation mechanisms and assist in designing safe battery systems, but need to be well-parametrized. Most of the heat during thermal runaway is released by venting that is why the characteristic of the vent flow plays an important part in the safety assessment. During venting, the cell generates a recoil force like a rocket, which depends on the flow speed and flow rate of the gas. This principle is used in this work to measure the velocity and mass flow rate of the vent gas. High-power and high-energy 18650 format lithium-ion batteries were overheated and the recoil and weight forces were measured to determine the venting parameter during thermal runaway. Our results show, that the linearized gas flow rate for the high-power and high-energy cell is [Math Processing Error] 22.15 gs − 1 and [Math Processing Error] 27.92 gs − 1 , respectively. The progress of the gas velocity differs between the two cell types and in case of the high-energy cell, it follows a single peak asymmetrical pattern with a peak of [Math Processing Error] 398.5 ms − 1 , while the high-power cell shows a bumpy pattern with a maximum gas velocity of [Math Processing Error] 260.9 ms − 1 .

Therefore, aiming to bridge the gap between the lab-developed models and the field operational data, this paper presents a feature engineering-based SOH estimation method with downgraded laboratory battery data, applicable to real vehicles under different operating conditions. Firstly, a data processing pipeline is proposed to downgrade laboratory data to operational fleet-level data.

Finally, three machine learning (ML) algorithms for easy online deployment are employed for SOH assessment. The results show that the hybrid feature set performs well and has high accuracy in SOH estimation for downgraded data, with a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36%. Only three mechanism features derived from the incremental capacity curve can still provide a proper assessment, with a minimum RMSE of 0.44%. Voltage-based features can assist in evaluating battery state, improving accuracy by up to 20%. Full article"

Effective ESS and photovoltaic (PV) energy usage prices are modeled and an efficient energy flow management algorithm is presented, which considers the life cycle of the ESSs including batteries, electrical vehicles (EVs) and the efficient use of the PV system while reducing the cost of energy consumption. In addition, an optimization technique is employed to obtain the optimal ESS parameters including the size and depth of discharge (DOD), considering the installation cost, levelized cost of storage (LCOS), winter and summer conditions, energy consumption profile, and energy prices. Finally, an optimization technique is applied to obtain the optimal energy consumption scheduling. The proposed system provides all of the possibilities of exchanging energy between EV, battery, PV system, grid, and home. The optimization problem is solved using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) in MATLAB with an interval time of one minute. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed system, presenting an actual cost reduction of 28.9% and 17.7% in summer and winter, respectively, compared to a base scenario. Similarly, the energy losses were reduced by 26.7% in winter and 22.3% in summer, and the EV battery lifetime was extended from 9.2 to 19.1 years in the winter scenario and from 10.4 to 17.7 years in the summer scenario. The integrated system provided a financial contribution during the operational lifetime of EUR 11,600 and 7900 in winter and summer scenarios, respectively. The CO 2 was reduced by 59.7% and 46.2% in summer and winter scenarios, respectively. Full article"

An accurate prognosis of the remaining useful life (RUL) is essential for ensuring effective second-life operation. Diagnosis is a necessary step for the establishment of a reliable prognosis, based on the aging modes involved in a cell. This paper introduces a method for characterizing specific aging phenomenon in Graphite/Lithium Iron Phosphate (G/LFP) cells. This method aims to identify aging related to the loss of active material at the negative electrode (LAM NE ). The identification and tracking of the state of health (SoH) are based on Incremental Capacity Analysis (ICA) and Differential Voltage Analysis (DVA) peak-tracking techniques. The remaining capacity of the electrode is thus evaluated based on these diagnostic results, using a model derived from half-cell electrode characterization. The method is used on a G/LFP cell in the format 18650, with a nominal capacity of 1.1 Ah, aged from its pristine state to 40% of state of health. Full article"

However, optimizing thermal management systems at both the cell and pack levels is also key to achieving mission-relevant battery design. Battery thermal management systems, responsible for managing the thermal profile of battery cells, are crucial for balancing the trade-offs between battery performance and lifetime. Designing such systems requires accounting for the multitude of heat sources within battery cells and packs. This paper provides a summary of heat generation characterizations observed in several commercial Li-ion battery cells using isothermal battery calorimetry. The primary focus is on assessing the impact of temperatures, C-rates, and formation cycles. Moreover, a module-level characterization demonstrated the significant additional heat generated by module interconnects. Characterizing heat signatures at each level helps inform manufacturing at the design, production, and characterization phases that might otherwise go unaccounted for at the full pack level. Further testing of a 5 kWh battery pack revealed that a considerable temperature non-uniformity may arise due to inefficient cooling arrangements. To mitigate this type of challenge, a combined thermal characterization and multi-domain modeling approach is proposed, offering a solution without the need for constructing a costly module prototype.

Ongoing research aims to enhance the stability of lithium metal batteries for commercialization. Among the studies, research on N-based electrolyte additives, which can stabilize the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and provide stability to the lithium metal surface, holds great promise. The NO 3 − anion in the N-based electrolyte additive causes the SEI layer on the lithium metal surface to contain compounds such as Li 3 N and Li 2 O, which not only facilitates the conduction of Li + ions in the SEI layer but also increases its mechanical strength. However, due to challenges with the solubility of N-based electrolyte additives in carbonate-based electrolytes, extensive research has been conducted on electrolytes based on ethers. Nonetheless, the low oxidative stability of ether-based electrolytes hinders their practical application. Hence, a strategy is needed to incorporate N-based electrolyte additives into carbonate-based electrolytes. In this review, we address the challenges of lithium metal batteries and propose practical approaches for the application and development of N-based electrolyte additives. Full article"

Recently, it was proposed for application as an anode for Sodium and Lithium-Ion Batteries (SIBs and LIBs) thanks to its combined conversion and alloying electrochemical mechanism. However, its entire potential is limited by the poor electronic conductivity and volumetric expansion during cycling. In the present paper, pure and Sn or Mg doped GFO samples obtained from mechano-chemical solid-state synthesis and properly carbon coated were structurally and electrochemically characterized and proposed, for the first time, as anodes for SIBs. The spinel cubic structure of pure GFO is maintained in doped samples. The expected redox processes, involving Fe and Ge ions, are evidenced in the electrochemical tests. The Sn doping demonstrated a beneficial effect on the long-term cycling (providing 150 mAh/g at 0.2 C after 120 cycles) and on the capacity values (346 mAh/g at 0.2 C with respect to 300 mAh/g of the pure one), while the Mg substitution was less effective.

This paper presents a pioneering investigation of the electrolyte flow dynamics inside FB tanks. This study considers the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) measured at the stack of a 9 kW/27 kWh Vanadium FB with 500 L tanks. Order-of-magnitude estimates of the measured dynamics suggest that differences in densities and viscosities of the active species drive gradients of concentrations with different patterns in the positive and negative tanks and in charge and discharge, affected by current and flow rate, which result in significant deviation from homogeneity, affecting the State of Charge (SoC) of the electrolytes flowed into the stack and thus the FB performance. In particular, stratifications of the inlet electrolytes may appear which are responsible for delays in reaching the outlets, with initial plateau and following step (s) in the SoC at the stack. These events can have a major impact in the performance of industrial FBs with large tanks and suggest that specific tank designs may improve the overall dynamics, calling for further analysis.

Small particles are preferred to obtain a high active mass loading of cathode active material and a small porosity in composite cathodes. In this work, the influence of the solid fraction in the wet-chemical synthesis of β-Li 3 PS 4 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is investigated. The solid fraction is varied between 50 and 200 mg/mL, and the obtained samples are evaluated using X-ray diffraction, SEM and electrochemical impedance measurements. The sizes of the resulting particles show a significant dependency on the solid fraction, while a good ionic conductivity is maintained. For the highest concentration, the particle sizes do not exceed 10 µm, but for the lowest concentration, particles up to ~73 µm can be found. The ionic conductivities at room temperature are determined to be 0.63 ± 0.01 × 10 −4 S/cm and 0.78 ± 0.01 × 10 −4 S/cm for the highest and lowest concentrations, respectively. These findings lead to an improvement towards the production of tailored sulfide solid electrolytes. Full article"

Smart and reconfigurable batteries are a promising alternative to conventional battery packs and offer new possibilities for operation and condition monitoring. This work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to balance the State of Charge (SoC) of reconfigurable batteries based on the topologies half-bridge and battery modular multilevel management (BM3). As an RL algorithm, Amortized Q-learning (AQL) is implemented, which enables the control of enormous numbers of possible configurations of the reconfigurable battery as well as the combination of classical controlling approaches and machine learning methods. This enhances the safety mechanisms during control. As a neural network of the AQL, a Feedforward Neuronal Network (FNN) is implemented consisting of three hidden layers. The experimental evaluation using a 12-cell hybrid cascaded multilevel converter illustrates the applicability of the method to balance the SoC and maintain the balanced state during discharge. The evaluation shows a 20.3% slower balancing process compared to a conventional approach. Nevertheless, AQL shows great potential for multiobjective optimizations and can be applied as an RL algorithm for control in power electronics. Full article"

This study addresses the need to assess and identify viable metal-ion battery alternatives to Li-ion batteries, focusing on the rapidly industrializing context of Vietnam. It acknowledges the criticality of developing a sustainable, cost-effective, and resource-efficient energy storage solution that aligns with the country’s growth trajectory. The primary objective is to evaluate the suitability of emerging metal-ion batteries—specifically sodium-ion (SIB), sodium-ion saltwater (SIB-S), magnesium-ion (MIB), and zinc-ion (ZIB)—for Vietnam’s energy storage needs, guiding future investment and policy decisions. A Fuzzy Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach is employed, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative criteria. This study utilizes the Fuzzy Best-Worst Method (BWM) to determine the relative importance of various performance indicators and then applies the Bonferroni Fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (Bonferroni FCoCoSo) method to rank the battery alternatives. The SIBs emerged as the most promising alternative, scoring the highest in the overall evaluation. The MIBs and SIB-saltwater batteries displayed competitive potential, while the ZIBs ranked the lowest among the considered options.

However, the capacity and performance of lithium-ion batteries gradually degrade with the number of charge or discharge cycles and environmental conditions, which can affect the reliability and lifetime of the batteries, so it is necessary to accurately evaluate their health. The belief rule base (BRB) model is an evaluation model constructed based on rules that can handle uncertainties in the operation of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium-ion batteries may be affected by disturbances from internal or external sources during operation, which may affect the evaluation results. To prevent this problem, this paper proposes a disturbance-considering BRB modeling approach that considers the possible effects of disturbances on the battery in the operating environment and quantifies the disturbance-considering capability of the assessment model in combination with expert knowledge. Second, robustness and interpretability constraints are added in this paper, and an improved optimization algorithm is constructed that maintains or possibly improves the resistance of the model to disturbance. Finally, using the lithium-ion batteries provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Prediction Centre of Excellence and the University of Maryland as a case study, this paper verifies that the proposed modeling approach is capable of constructing robust models and demonstrates the effectiveness of the improved optimization algorithm.

When this is high, degradation of the electrolyte occurs. The impurities generated in its decomposition reduce the accessibility of the ions to the porous structure on the surface of the electrode, which reduces its capacity and increases its internal resistance. In some applications, such as electric vehicles whose storage system consists of SCs, fast chargers, which supply very high power, are used. This can lead to an increase in temperature and accelerated aging of the cells. Therefore, it is important to know how the temperature of the SCs evolves in these cases and what parameters it depends on, both electrical and thermal. In this contribution, mathematical formulae have been developed to determine the evolution of the temperature in time and its maximum value during the transient state. The formulae for obtaining the mean and maximum temperature, once the thermal steady state (TSS) has been reached, are also shown, considering that the charger cells are recharged from the grid at a constant current. Based on this formulation, the thermal analysis of a specific case is determined. Full article"

On this basis, a battery arc evolution model based on magnetohydrodynamics is established to analyze the arc’s electro-thermal coupling characteristics to further obtain the distribution of the arc’s multi-physical field. The results show that the arc generated by the high-voltage grade battery pack will break down the cell’s shell and form a hole, resulting in electrolyte leakage. When the loop current is 10 A, the evolution law of arc voltage and current is basically the same under different supply voltages, charges, and discharges. The accuracy of the battery arc simulation model is verified by comparing the simulation with the experimental results. The research in this paper provides a theoretical basis for the electrical safety design of lithium-ion batteries caused by the arc, fills the gaps in the field of battery system arc simulation, and is of great significance for improving the safety performance of arc protection.

The full-order partial two-dimensional (P2D) model is a common physics-based cell-level LiB model that faces challenges for real-time BMS implementation due to the complexity of its numerical solver. In this paper, we propose a method to discretise the P2D model equations using the Finite Volume and Verlet Integration Methods to significantly reduce the computational complexity of the solver. Our proposed iterative solver uses novel convergence criteria and physics-based initial guesses to provide high fidelity for discretised P2D equations. We also include both the kinetic-limited and diffusion-limited models for Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) growth into an iterative P2D solver. With these SEI models, we can estimate the capacity fade in real time once the model is tuned to the cell–voltage curve. The results are validated using three different operation scenarios, including the 1C discharge/charge cycle, multiple-C-rate discharges, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory dynamic stress test. The proposed solver shows at least a 4.5 times improvement in performance with less than 1% error when compared to commercial solvers. Full article"

However, cells are affected by numerous aging phenomena which can lead to an acceleration in capacity loss. This paper uses postmortem techniques to compare aging phenomenon in 1.1 Ah 18650 graphite/LFP cells, examining the differences between a pristine cell and three cells aged to 40~30% of state of health (SoH). Macroscopic and microscopic techniques are used to identify aging phenomenon occurring in the cell on both positive and negative electrodes. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) with back-scattered electron (BSE) detector are used to analyze each electrode. These methods are used to analyze the morphology and the material on each electrode. The results show a stable positive LFP electrode whereas numerous deposits and cracking occurred on the negative electrode. A discussion of the appearance of those aging phenomenon is presented. Impacts for industrial cells in second-life applications are finally discussed. Full article"

Water remains one of the most efficient fire extinguishing agents for tackling such battery incidents, and large quantities are usually necessary. Since batteries contain various potentially harmful components (metals and their oxides or salts, solvents, etc.) and thermal-runaway-induced battery incidents are accompanied by complex and potentially multistage fume emissions (containing both gas and particles), the potential impact of fire run-off waters on the environment should be considered and assessed carefully. The tests presented in this paper focus on analyzing the composition of run-off waters used to spray NMC Li-ion modules under thermal runaway. It highlights that waters used for firefighting are susceptible to containing many metals, including Ni, Mn, Co, Li and Al, mixed with other carbonaceous species (soot, tarballs) and sometimes undecomposed solvents used in the electrolyte. Extrapolation of pollutant concentrations compared with PNEC values showed that, for large-scale incidents, run-off water could be potentially hazardous to the environment. Full article"

However, the uneven deposition and stripping of lithium cause irreversible damage to the graphite structure, and the low flash point and high flammability of the carbonate electrolyte pose a significant fire safety risk. Here, we proposed a multifunctional electrolyte additive diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA), which can construct a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high ionic conductivity lithium nitride (Li 3 N) to ensure efficient transport of Li + . This not only protects the artificial graphite (AG) electrode but also inhibits lithium dendrites to achieve excellent electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, the LIBS with DPPA offers satisfactory flame retardancy performance. The AG//Li half cells with DPPA-0.5M can still maintain a specific capacity of about 350 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Its cycle performance and rate performance were better than commercial electrolyte (EC/DMC). After cycling, the microstructure surface of the AG electrode was complete and flat, and the surface of the lithium metal electrode had fewer lithium dendrites. Importantly, we found that the pouch cell with DPPA-0.5M had low peak heat release rate. When exposed to external conditions of continuous heating, DPPA significantly improved the fire safety of the LIBS. The research of DPPA in lithium electrolyte is a step towards the development of safe and efficient lithium batteries. Full article"

In response to these environmental concerns, numerous countries encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as a more environmentally friendly option than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Advances in battery technology have made batteries an alternative solution for energy storage in stationary applications and for electric mobility. Reduced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) production costs due to economies of scale, electrode material and cell design developments, and manufacturing process improvements have driven this success. This trend is expected to increase the number of LIBs on the market that may be discarded in the environment at the end of their useful life if more sustainable alternatives are not technologically mature. This coming environmental concern can be mitigated by collecting wasted EV batteries, reconfiguring them, and reusing them for applications with less stringent weight, performance, and size requirements. This method would extend battery life and reduce environmental effects. The present work investigates the main regulatory structures of the second-life battery industry that require rules, technical standards, and laws. To achieve this objective, a systematic review was carried out following a strict protocol that includes identifying relevant studies, extracting data and information, evaluating, and summarizing information. This paper explains the primary rules and technical standards governing the second-life battery business. The findings highlight the need for universities, research institutions, and government agencies to evaluate the second-life battery industry objectively.

This paper presents a new thermal management approach to address the battery heat accumulation challenge through a novel combination of composite phase change material (CPCM) with liquid cooling systems. An optimised hybrid cooling model is developed to evaluate the proposed battery thermal management system (BTMS) under high-temperature and high-power conditions. Benchmark studies are conducted to assess the impact of inlet position, inlet flow rate, and flow channel distribution on the cooling performance to achieve a uniform temperature distribution within the battery. The optimised BTMS, consisting of a five-cell battery pack, demonstrates a maximum temperature of 41.15 °C and a temperature difference of 4.89 °C in a operating condition at 36 °C with a discharge rate of 3 C. The BTMS outperforms the initial model, reducing the maximum temperature by 1.5%, temperature difference by 5%, and liquid fraction by 13%, with a slight (1.3%) increase in weight. The cooling performance is most efficient at a liquid flow rate of 0.1 m/s, minimising energy consumption. The proposed BTMS with CPCM-3 is also sufficient enough to keep the battery pack under a thermal runaway event. Overall, the theoretical simulation highlights the BTMS’s ability to effectively control battery temperatures and temperature differences, ensuring safe operation during high-temperature and high-power conditions in practical EV usage.

These dendritic structures not only impair battery performance but also pose safety risks. Among the non-destructive analytical techniques in battery research, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) stands out as a promising tool. However, the direct imaging of lithium by 7 Li MRI is limited by its low sensitivity and spatial resolution, making it a less effective way of imaging dendrite growth. Instead, a recently introduced indirect imaging approach which is based on 1 H MRI of the electrolyte was used in this study. This method was used to sequentially 3D image and thus monitor the charging process of lithium metal symmetric cells in three different electrical circuits, namely those composed of a single cell, four cells in parallel, and four cells in series. The measured sequential images allowed for the measurement of dendrite growth in each cell using volumetric analysis. The growth results confirmed the theoretical prediction that the growth across cells is uneven in a parallel circuit, and even in a series circuit. The methods presented in this study can also be applied to analyze many other dendrite-related issues in batteries. Full article"

However, the state of health of batteries is unmeasurable and, currently, it is usually estimated within a specific area of the whole charging data, which is very limited in practical application because of the incomplete and random charging behaviors of users. In this paper, we intend to estimate the state of health of batteries with flexible partial charging curves and normal multi-layer perceptron based on the degradation data of eight 0.74 Ah batteries. To make the estimation more adaptive and flexible, we extract several features from partial charging curves. Analysis of the relationship between extracted features and the state of health shows that the extracted features are useful in estimation. As the length of the partial charging curve increases, the extracted features still function well, and the root mean square error of the test set is lower than 1.5%. Further validation on the other two types of batteries reveals that the proposed method achieves high accuracy even with different sampling and working conditions. The proposed method offers an easy-to-implement way to achieve an accurate estimation of a battery’s state of health. Full article"

These results offer valuable insights into the potential of PVAc-based polymers for advancing high-performance solid-state sodium-ion batteries by reducing their total internal resistance.

In this paper, a lithium-ion battery state of health estimation method with sample transfer learning under dynamic test conditions is proposed. Through the Tradaboost.R2 method, the weight of the source domain sample data is adjusted to complete the update of the sample data distribution. At the same time, considering the division methods of the six auxiliary and the source domain data set, aging features from different state of charge ranges are selected. It is verified that while the aging feature dimension and the demand for target domain label data are reduced, the estimation accuracy of the lithium-ion battery state of health is not affected by the initial value of the state of charge. By considering the mean absolute error, mean square error and root mean square error, the estimated error results do not exceed 1.2% on the experiment battery data, which highlights the advantages of the proposed methods.

The cathode was prepared using a water-based carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solution and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) as the binder while Li 6 PS 5 F 0.5 Cl 0.5 SSE was synthesized using a solvent-based process, via the introduction of LiF into the argyrodite crystal structure, which enhances both the ionic conductivity and interface-stabilizing properties of the SSE. Ionic liquids (IL) were prepared using lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the salt, with pre-mixed pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (PYR) as solvent and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) as diluent, and they were used to wet the SSE–electrode interfaces. The effect of IL dilution, the co-solvent amount, the LiTFSI concentration, the C rate at which the batteries are tested and the effect of the introduction of SSE in the cathode, were systematically studied and optimized to develop a QSSEB with higher capacity retention and cyclability. Interfacial reactions occurring at the cathode–SSE interface during cycling were also investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supported by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This work offers a new insight into the intimate interfacial contacts between the SSE and carbon–sulfur cathodes, which are critical for improving the electrochemical performance of quasi-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries.

Additionally, it introduces the adaptive sliding mode observer algorithm (ASMO) to achieve robust and swiftly accurate estimation of the state of charge (SOC) of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries during electric vehicle duty cycles. The established simplified hysteresis model in this paper significantly enhances the fitting accuracy during charging and discharging processes, compensating for voltage deviations induced by hysteresis characteristics. The SOC estimation, even in the face of model parameter changes under complex working conditions during electric vehicle duty cycles, maintains high robustness by capitalizing on the easy convergence and parameter insensitivity of ASMO. Lastly, experiments conducted under different temperatures and FUDS and DST conditions validate that the SOC estimation of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, based on the adaptive sliding-mode observer and the simplified hysteresis model, exhibits enhanced robustness and faster convergence under complex working conditions and temperature variations during electric vehicle duty cycles.

However, the growth of the second-life market is limited by the lack of information on the characteristics and performance of these batteries. As the volume of end-of-life EVs may exceed the amount of batteries needed for stationary applications, investigating the possibility of repurposing them in mobile applications is also necessary. This article presents an experimental test that can be used to collect the data necessary to fill a battery passport. The proposed procedure can facilitate the decision-making process regarding the suitability of a battery for reuse at the end of its first life. Once the battery passport has been completed, the performance and characteristics of the battery are compared with the requirements of several mobile applications. Mobile charging stations and forklift trucks were identified as relevant applications for the reuse of high-capacity prismatic cells. Finally, a definition of the state of health (SoH) is proposed to track the suitability of the battery during use in the second-life application considering not only the energy but also the power and efficiency of the battery. This SoH shows that even taking into account accelerated ageing data, a repurposed battery can have an extended life of 11 years at 25 °C. It has also been shown that energy fade is the most limiting performance factor for the lifetime and that cell-to-cell variation should be tracked as it has been shown to have a significant impact on the battery life.

Precise estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries holds significant function in intelligent battery management systems (BMS). Therefore, in order to increase the fidelity and stabilization of predicting the RUL of lithium-ion batteries, in this paper, an innovative strategy for RUL prediction is proposed by integrating a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and a bilayer long short-term memory (BLSTM) neural network. Feature extraction is carried out through the input capacity data of the model using 1D CNN, and these deep features are used as the input of the BLSTM. The memory function of the BLSTM is applied to retain key information in the database and to better understand the coupling relationship among consecutive time series data along the time axis, thereby effectively predicting the RUL trends of lithium-ion batteries. Two different types of lithium-ion battery datasets from NASA and CALCE were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method achieves higher prediction accuracy, demonstrates stronger generalization capabilities, and effectively reduces prediction errors compared to other methods.

It was found by calculations and measurements that there is a cooling component in the lead-acid battery system which is caused by the endothermic discharge reactions and electrolysis of water during charging, related to entropy change contribution. Thus, under certain circumstances, it is possible to lower the temperature of the lead-acid battery during its discharging. The Joule heat generated on the internal resistance of the cell due to current flow, the exothermic charging reaction, and above all, the gradual increase in polarization as the cell voltage increases during charging all contribute to the heating of the cell, overtaking the cooling effect. Of these three sources of thermal energy, Joule heating in polarization resistance contributes the most to the temperature rise in the lead-acid battery. Thus, the maximum voltage reached determines the slope of the temperature rise in the lead-acid battery cell, and by a suitably chosen limiting voltage, it is possible to limit the danger of the “thermal runaway” effect. The overall thermal conditions of the experimental cell are significantly affected by the ambient temperature of the external environment and the rate of heat transfer through the walls of the calorimeter. A series of experiments with direct temperature measurement of individual locations within a lead-acid battery uses a calorimeter made of expanded polystyrene to minimize external influences. A hitherto unpublished phenomenon is discussed whereby the temperature of the positive electrode was lower than that of the negative electrode throughout the discharge, while during charging, the order was reversed and the temperature of the positive electrode was higher than that of the negative electrode throughout the charge. The authors relate this phenomenon to the higher reaction entropy change of the active mass of the positive electrode than that of the negative electrode. Full article"

The dynamic parameters described by the ECM are used by the BMS to estimate the battery state of charge (SOC), which is crucial for efficient charging/discharging, range calculations, and the overall safe operation of electric vehicles. Typically, the ECM approach represents the dynamic characteristics of the battery in a mathematical form with a limited number of unknown parameters. Then, the parameters are calculated from voltage and current information of the lithium-ion cell obtained from controlled experiments. In the current work, a faster and simplified first-order resistance–capacitance (RC) equivalent circuit model was developed for a commercial cylindrical cell (LGM50 21700). An analytical solution was developed for the equivalent circuit model incorporating SOC and temperature-dependent RC parameters. The solution to the RC circuit model was derived using multiple expressions for different components like open circuit voltage (OCV), instantaneous resistance (R 0 ), and diffusional parameters (R 1 and C 1 ) as a function of the SOC and operating temperature. The derived parameters were validated against the virtual HPPC test results of a validated physics-based electrochemical model for the voltage behavior. Using the developed RC circuit model, a polynomial expression is derived to estimate the temperature increase of the cell including both irreversible and reversible heat generation components. The temperature predicted by the proposed RC circuit model at different battery operating temperatures is in good agreement with the values obtained from the validated physics model.

When it comes to applications in electrochemical capacitors, hybrid electrolytes are expected to fill the gap between high-voltage organic systems and their high discharge rate aqueous counterparts. This article discusses the potential applicability of aqueous–organic electrolytes utilizing water/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solvent mixture, and sodium perchlorate as a source of charge carriers. The hydrogen bond formation between H 2 O and DMAc (mole fraction x DMAc = 0.16) is shown to regulate the original water and cation solvation structure, thus reducing the electrochemical activity of the primary aqueous solution both in the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions region. As a result, an electrochemical stability window of 3.0 V can be achieved on titanium electrodes while providing reasonable ionic conductivity of 39 mS cm −1 along with the electrolyte’s flame retardant and anti-freezing properties. Based on the diagnostic electrochemical studies, the operation conditions for carbon/carbon capacitors have been carefully optimized to adjust the potential ranges of the individual electrodes to the electrochemical stability region. The system with the appropriate electrode mass ratio ( m + / m − = 1.51) was characterized by a wide operating voltage of 2.0 V, gravimetric energy of 13.2 Wh kg −1 , and practically a 100% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles. This translates to a significant rise in the maximum energy of 76% when compared to the aqueous counterpart. Additionally, reasonable charge–discharge rates and anti-freeze properties of the developed electrolyte enable application in a broad temperature range down to −20 °C, which is demonstrated as well.

With the high costs of the BESS and PV, optimal placement and capacity of them must be carefully considered. This work proposes a solution for determining the optimal placement and capacity of a BESS and photovoltaic (PV) in a distribution system by considering EV penetrations. The objective function is to reduce system costs, comprising installation, replacement, and operation and maintenance costs of the BESS and PV. The replacement cost is considered over 20 years, and the maintenance and operation costs incurred in the distribution system include transmission line loss, voltage regulation, and peak demand costs. To solve the problem, two metaheuristic algorithms consisting of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the African vulture optimization algorithm (AVOA) are utilized. The tenth feeder of Phitsanulok substation 1 (PLA10), Thailand, which is a 91-bus distribution network, is tested to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results obtained from the considered algorithms are compared based on distribution system performance enhancement, payback period, and statistical analysis.

Investigating charging techniques is crucial for optimizing the charging time, charging efficiency, and cycle life of the battery cells. This study introduces a real-time charging monitoring platform based on LabVIEW, enabling observation of battery parameters such as voltage, current, and temperature. The proposed system allows the precise control of charging parameters via a user-friendly interface. Utilizing a programmable DC power supply, it delivers specific charging waveforms, while data acquisition instruments record temperature changes. Key performance metrics, including charging time, efficiency, and temperature rise, are analyzed. Moreover, this paper conducts in-depth research on the constant temperature–constant voltage (CT-CV) charging technique and applies the Taguchi method to identify key parameter configurations that achieve the objectives of the shortest charging time, highest charging efficiency, and lowest average temperature rise. A comprehensive evaluation compares the optimized CT-CV method with conventional constant current–constant voltage (CC-CV) charging. The results demonstrate a 10.7% reduction in charging time compared to the 1C CC-CV method, indicating the efficacy of CT-CV in shortening charging duration while managing temperature rise.

Effects of Electrolyte Solvent Composition on Solid Electrolyte Interphase Properties in Lithium Metal Batteries: Focusing on Ethylene Carbonate to Ethyl Methyl Carbonate Ratios,"Paul Maldonado Nogales, Sangyup Lee, Seunga Yang, Soon-Ki Jeong",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060210,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/6/210/pdf?version=1718542153,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/6/210,7,"This study investigated the influence of variations in the mixing ratio of ethylene carbonate (EC) to ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) on the composition and effectiveness of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-metal batteries. The SEI is crucial for battery performance, as it prevents continuous electrolyte decomposition and inhibits the growth of lithium dendrites, which can cause internal short circuits leading to battery failure. Although the properties of the SEI largely depend on the electrolyte solvent, the influence of the EC:EMC ratio on SEI properties has not yet been elucidated. Through electrochemical testing, ionic conductivity measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the formation of Li 2 CO 3 , LiF, and organolithium compounds on lithium surfaces was systematically analyzed. This study demonstrated that the EC:EMC ratio significantly affected the SEI structure, primarily owing to the promotion of the formation of a denser SEI layer. Specifically, the ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 facilitated a uniform distribution and prevalence of Li 2 CO 3 and LiF throughout the SEI, thereby affecting cell performance. Thus, precise control of the EC:EMC ratio is essential for enhancing the mechanical robustness and electrochemical stability of the SEI, thereby providing valuable insights into the factors that either enhance or impede effective SEI formation.

Study of the Suitability of Corncob Biochar as Electrocatalyst for Zn–Air Batteries,"Nikolaos Soursos, Theodoros Kottis, Vasiliki Premeti, John Zafeiropoulos, Katerina Govatsi, Lamprini Sygellou, John Vakros, Ioannis D.

Zn–air batteries possess some significant advantages; however, there are still problems to solve, especially related to the tuning of the properties of the air–cathode which should carry an inexpensive but efficient bifunctional oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reaction electrocatalyst. Biochar can be an alternative, since it is a material of low cost, it exhibits electric conductivity, and it can be used as support for transition metal ions. Although there is a significant number of publications on biochars, there is a lack of data about biochar from raw biomass rich in hemicellulose, and biochar with a small number of heteroatoms, in order to report the pristine activity of the carbon phase. In this work, activated biochar has been made by using corncobs. The biomass was first dried and minced into small pieces and pyrolyzed. Then, it was mixed with KOH and pyrolyzed for a second time. The final product was characterized by various techniques and its electroactivity as a cathode was determined. Physicochemical characterization revealed that the biochar had a hierarchical pore structure, moderate surface area of 92 m 2 g −1 , carbon phase with a relatively low sp 2 /sp 3 ratio close to one, and a limited amount of N and S, but a high number of oxygen groups. The graphitization was not complete while the biochar had an ordered structure and contained significant O species. This biochar was used as an electrocatalyst for ORR and OER in Zn–air batteries where it demonstrated a satisfactory performance. More specifically, it reached an open-circuit voltage of about 1.4 V, which was stable over a period of several hours, with a short-circuit current density of 142 mA cm −2 and a maximum power density of 55 mW cm −2 . Charge–discharge cycling of the battery was achieved between 1.2 and 2.1 V for a constant current of 10 mA. These data show that corncob biochar demonstrated good performance as an electrocatalyst in Zn–air batteries, despite its low specific surface and low sp 2 /sp 3 ratio, owing to its rich oxygen sites, thus showing that electrocatalysis is a complex phenomenon and can be served by biochars of various origins.

State of Charge Estimation of Lithium-ion Batteries Based on Online OCV Curve Construction,"Xuemei Wang, Ruiyun Gong, Zhao Yang, Longyun Kang",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060208,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/6/208/pdf?version=1718525929,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/6/208,7,"The open-circuit voltage (OCV) curve has a significant influence on the accuracy of the state of charge (SOC) estimation based on equivalent circuit models (ECMs). However, OCV curves are tested through offline experiments and are hard to be very accurate because they constantly change with the test method’s ambient temperature and aging status. Recently, researchers have attempted to improve the accuracy of OCV curves by increasing the volume of sample data or updating/reconstructing the curve combined with practical operation data. Still, prior offline tests are essential, and experimental errors inevitably exist. Consequently, a SOC estimation method without any offline OCV tests might be an efficient route to improve the accuracy of SOC. According to this idea, this paper presents a novel method for SOC estimation, which is based on online OCV curve construction. Meanwhile, a stepwise multi-timescale parameter identification algorithm is designed to improve the interpretability and precision of the estimated ECM parameters. The results demonstrate that the maximum SOC estimation error is only 0.05% at 25 °C, indicating good robustness under various ambient temperatures and operational conditions. Full article"

Here, we present a high-energy, high-safety, and temperature-adaptable aqueous proton battery utilizing two-dimensional Ti 3 C 2 T x MXenes as anode materials. Additionally, our work aims to provide further insights into the energy storage mechanism of Ti 3 C 2 T x in acid electrolytes. Our findings reveal that the ion transport mechanism of Ti 3 C 2 T x remains consistent in both H 2 SO 4 and H 3 PO 4 electrolytes. The mode of charge transfer depends on its terminal groups. Specifically, the hydrogen bonding network formed by water molecules adsorbed by hydroxyl functional groups under van der Waals forces enables charge transfer in the form of naked H + through the Grotthuss mechanism. In contrast, the hydrophobic channel formed by oxygen and halogen terminal groups facilitates rapid charge transfers in the form of hydronium ion via the vehicle mechanism, owing to negligible interfacial effect. Herein, we propose an aqueous proton battery based on porous hydroxy-poor Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene anode and pre-protonated Cu II [Fe III (CN) 6 ] 2/3 ∙4H 2 O (H-TBA) cathode in a 9.5 M H 3 PO 4 solution. This proton battery operates through hydrated H + /H + transfer, leading to good electrochemical performance, as evidenced by 26 Wh kg −1 energy density and 162 kW kg −1 power density at room temperature and an energy density of 17 Wh kg −1 and a power density of 7.4 kW kg −1 even at −60 °C.

To this end, modelling is one of the pillars for the innovation process. However, modelling batteries containing a large number of different mechanisms occurring at different scales remains a field of research that does not provide consensus for each particular model or approach. Parametrization as part of the modelling process appears to be one of the issues when it comes to building a high-fidelity model of a target cell. In this paper, a particular parameter identification is therefore discussed. Indeed, even if Butler–Volmer is a well-known equation in the electrochemistry field, identification of its reaction rate constant or exchange current density parameters is lacking in the literature. Thus, we discuss the process described in the literature and propose a new protocol that expects to overcome certain difficulties whereas the hypothesis of calculation and measurement maintains high sensitivity.

In the past, diesel generators with lead–acid battery energy storage systems (ESSs) were applied in most cases. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) systems with lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery ESSs have become suitable for solving this problem in a greener way. In 2016, an off-grid PV system with a Li-ion battery ESS was installed in Paiyun Lodge on Mt. Jade (the highest lodge in Taiwan). After operating for more than 7 years, the aging of the whole electric power system became a critical issue for its long-term usage. In this work, a method is established for analyzing the massive energy data (over 7 million rows), such as daily operation patterns, as well as the C-rate, temperature, and accumulated energy distributions, and estimating the health of the Li-ion battery system. A completed electric power improvement project dealing with power system aging is reported. Based on the long-term usage experience, a simple cost analysis model comparing lead–acid and Li-ion battery systems is built, revealing that expensive Li-ion batteries can compete with cheap lead–acid batteries for long-term usage on high mountains. This case study can provide engineers and researchers with a fundamental understanding of the long-term usage of off-grid PV ESSs and engineering on high mountains. Full article"

Charging times in lead–acid cells and batteries can be variable, and when used in PSOC operation, the manufacturer’s recommended charge times for single-cycle use are not necessarily applicable. Knowing how long charging will take and what the variability in time required is allows for better planning of operations and algorithm creation for battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturers. This paper details and demonstrates a procedure for identifying the charging time of cells when different charge throughputs occur prior to reaching full charge. The results showed that the charging time in PSOC operations was highly variable when a charge-factor-controlled full-charge procedure was used. Also noted were that higher voltages for the same state of charge were reached as the number of cycles following reaching full charge increased. None of the regimes tested in this paper caused any significant capacity degradation, which demonstrates that PSOC operations can be performed even on cells not specifically designed for them, provided the correct regime is chosen.

To enable the impact of the battery response to be assessed in conjunction with other electrified systems, battery emulators are used with advanced mathematical models describing the expected voltage output with respect to current load. This paper conducted research into different modeling types: electrochemical, thermal, and electronic equivalent circuit models (EECMs). EECMs were identified as the most suitable to be used in conjunction with emulation techniques. A foundation EECM was created in conjunction with a thermal part to simulate thermal dependency. Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) tests were conducted on an NMC Li-ion cell across a range of temperatures from −20 °C to 25 °C. Using parameter optimization techniques, the HPPC test data were used to identify the resistance, capacitance, and the open-circuit voltage of the cell across a range of state of charge bounds and across a temperature range of 0 °C to 25 °C. The foundation model was assessed using identified parameters on two current profiles derived from drive cycles across a temperature range of 0 °C to 10 °C.

This paper derives a new SOC estimation method (CNN-UKF) that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The measured voltage, current and temperature of the LIB are the input of the CNN. The output of the hidden layer feeds the linear layer, whose output corresponds to an initial network-based SOC estimation. The output of the CNN is then used as the input of a UKF, which, using self-correction, yields high-precision SOC estimation results. This method does not require tuning of network hyperparameters, reducing the dependence of the network on hyperparameter adjustment and improving the efficiency of the network. The experimental results show that this method has higher accuracy and robustness compared to SOC estimation methods based on CNN and other advanced methods found in the literature. Full article"

Robots exhibit robust load-bearing capacity and perform stable repetitive tasks, while humans possess subjective experiences and tacit knowledge. It makes the disassembly activity more adaptable and ergonomic. However, existing human–robot collaborative disassembly studies have neglected to account for time-varying human conditions, such as safety, cognitive behavior, workload, and human pose shifts. Firstly, in order to overcome the limitations of existing research, we propose a model for balancing human–robot collaborative disassembly lines that take into consideration the load factor related to human involvement. This entails the development of a multi-objective mathematical model aimed at minimizing both the cycle time of the disassembly line and its associated costs while also aiming to reduce the integrated smoothing exponent. Secondly, we propose a modified multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines chaos theory and the global cooperation mechanism to improve the performance of the algorithm. We add Gaussian mutation and crowding distance to efficiently solve the discrete optimization problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and sensitivity of the improved multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm by solving and analyzing an example of Mercedes battery pack disassembly.

On this basis, a carbon-coated aluminum foil collector with a full tab structure is designed and assembled with graphene/activated carbon hybrid electrodes to form a commercial supercapacitor in cylindrical configuration. The experimental tests confirmed that such supercapacitors have high capacity density, power density, low internal resistance (about 0.06 mΩ), good high-current charging/discharging characteristics, and a long lifetime, with more than 80% capacity retention after 10 W cycles.

Therefore, SOH modelling is in the process of shifting from using simple and continuous charge/discharge profiles to more dynamic profiles constructed to mimic real operation when ageing the Li-ion batteries. However, in most cases, when ageing the batteries, the same exact profile is just repeated until the battery reaches its end of life. Using data from batteries aged in this fashion to create a model, there is a very real possibility that the model will rely on the built-in repetitiveness of the profile. Therefore, this work will examine the dependence of the performance of a multiple linear regression on the number of charges used to train the model, and their location within the profile used to age the batteries. The investigation shows that it is possible to train models using randomly selected partial charges while still reaching errors as low as 0.5%. Furthermore, it shows that only one randomly sampled partial charge is needed to achieve errors smaller than 1%. Lastly, as the number of randomly sampled partial charges used to train the model increases, the dependence on particular partial charges tends to decrease. Full article"

In this article, hierarchical porosity was introduced to commercially available carbon paper cathodes by thermal pretreatment in air at different pretreatment times. This pretreatment modifies the properties, such as surface area, defects, oxygen functional groups, etc. The discharge performance was determined at three different current densities, i.e., 0.1 mA/cm 2 , 0.5 mA/cm 2 , and 1.0 mA/cm 2 . It has been found that an increase in specific surface area with the introduction of micropores and mesopores is beneficial for the improvement in the discharge capacity by enabling homogeneous discharge product, KO 2 distribution and high degrees of pore filling over the volume of the cathode. A reduction in the discharge overpotentials was observed, which is attributed to the introduction of oxygenic functional groups and defects. Samples treated for the longest pretreatment time of 24 h showed the highest discharge capacity of 5 mAh/cm 2 and lowest discharge overpotential of 0.03 V. Full article"

A crucial step for battery reuse or recycling is the precise estimation of static capacity at retirement. Traditional methods are time-consuming, often taking several hours. To address this issue, a machine learning-based approach is introduced to estimate the static capacity of retired batteries rapidly and accurately. Partial discharge data at a 1 C rate over durations of 6, 3, and 1 min were analyzed using a machine learning algorithm that effectively handles temporally evolving data. The estimation performance of the methodology was evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results showed reliable and fairly accurate estimation performance, even with data from shorter partial discharge durations. For the one-minute discharge data, the maximum RMSE was 2.525%, the minimum was 1.239%, and the average error was 1.661%. These findings indicate the successful implementation of rapidly assessing the static capacity of EV batteries with minimal error, potentially revitalizing the retired battery recycling industry.

This includes the use of electric or hybrid vehicles whose energy storage system is based on batteries of various types, including lithium-ion batteries. The optimum operating temperature is between 15 °C and 35 °C. Too high temperatures can lead to catastrophic phenomena such as thermal runaway. The thermal gradient within the system should not exceed 5 °C. An effective Battery Thermal Management System can mitigate this problem. This study analysed a lithium-ion battery with a bag structure. Temperature control was evaluated using a passive (low-cost) system with phase-change materials (PCMs). The material chosen was n-octadecane (paraffin) due to its thermophysical properties and market price. Four different cooling methods were analysed, including air, fins, pure PCM, and a mixed system of single cells and small battery packs. The results show that an undesirable temperature peak around 50 °C (323.15 K) can occur at hot spots. The best system for containing the temperature inside the battery pack is the PCM cooling system with fins. The optimum fin thickness is 1.5 mm. To contain the temperature inside the battery pack, the number of fins studied is 10, while the best temperature containment is achieved with n+ 1 plates, where n is the number of cells.

Herein, a fast Li + transfer scaffold is proposed to overcome the sluggish kinetics at the Li/SE interface in ASSLMBs using an α-MnO 2 -decorated carbon paper (CP) structure (α-MnO 2 @CP). At an atomic scale, the tunnel structure of α-MnO 2 exhibits a great ability to facilitate Li + adsorption and transportation across the inter-structure of α-MnO 2 @CP, leading to a high critical current density of 3.95 mA cm −2 at the Li/SE interface. Meanwhile, uniform Li deposition can be guided along the skeletons of α-MnO 2 @CP with minimized volume expansion, significantly improving the structural stability of the Li/SE interface. Based on these advantages, the ASSLMBs using α-MnO 2 @CP protected the Li anode and can stably cycle up to very high charge/discharge rates of 10C/10C, paving the way for developing high-power ASSLMBs.

The equivalent circuit model (ECM) technique at the cell level is commonly employed for this purpose, offering a balance of accuracy and efficiency in representing battery operation within the broader powertrain system. In this study, a second-order ECM model of a battery cell has been developed to ensure high accuracy and performance. Modelica, an acausal and object-oriented equation-based modeling language, has been used for its advantageous features, including the development of extendable, modifiable, modular, and reusable models. Parameter lookup tables at multiple levels of state of charge (SoC), extracted from lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cells with four different commonly used cathode materials, have been utilized. This approach allows for the representation of the battery systems that are used in a wide range of commercial EV applications. To verify the model, an integrated EV model is developed, and the simulation results of the US Environmental Protection Agency Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75) driving cycle have been compared with an equivalent application in MATLAB Simulink. The findings demonstrate a close match between the results obtained from both models across different system points. Specifically, the maximum vehicle velocity deviation during the cycle reaches 1.22 km/h, 8.2% lower than the corresponding value of the reference application. The maximum deviation of SoC is limited to 0.06%, and the maximum value of relative voltage deviation is 1.49%.

However, existing data-driven battery state estimation methods suffer from fixed input structures, high dependence on data quality, and limitations in scenarios where only early charge–discharge cycle data are available. To address these challenges, we propose a capacity degradation estimation method that utilizes shorter charging segments for multiple battery types. A learning-based model called GateCNN-BiLSTM is developed. To improve the accuracy of the basic model in small-sample scenarios, we integrate a single-source domain feature transfer learning framework based on maximum mean difference (MMD) and a multi-source domain framework using the meta-learning MAML algorithm. We validate the proposed algorithm using various LIB cell and battery pack datasets. Comparing the results with other models, we find that the GateCNN-BiLSTM algorithm achieves the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for cell charging capacity estimation, and can accurately estimate battery capacity degradation based on actual charging data from electric vehicles. Moreover, the proposed method exhibits low dependence on the size of the dataset, improving the accuracy of capacity degradation estimation for multi-type batteries with limited data. Full article"

This study investigates Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) as a tool for monitoring lithium-ion battery State-of-Health (SoH). While FDR has been applied in battery research, the existing literature fails to address SoH assessment and lacks studies on larger battery samples to provide more meaningful results. In this work, nineteen cells initially underwent Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to assess their degradation levels during cyclic aging. This work evaluates FDR’s effectiveness in monitoring battery health indicators, such as capacity and equivalent series resistance (ESR), by correlating these with FDR-measured impedance between 300 kHz and 1 GHz. Analytical comparison between impedance measured before and after de-embedding processes were presented. The results show FDR reactance within 300 kHz–40 MHz correlates with EIS-measured ESR, suggesting its potential as a SoH indicator. However, reduced sensitivity and accuracy, particularly after de-embedding, may limit practical applicability. Additionally, resonance-based analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between changes in circuit resonance and cell dielectric permittivity. Despite having the lowest sensitivity, the method showed that the resonance frequencies of cells remain relatively constant, mirroring behaviours associated with changes in resistive properties. Overall, this study provides insights into FDR’s potential for battery diagnostics while highlighting avenues for future research to enhance effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Full article"

However, the inhomogeneity of their internal temperature cannot be accurately measured at different constant charge and discharge power, affecting the efficiency and safety of the battery. This work adopts finite element analysis to determine the typical internal temperature of a single-cell model, which can guide the measuring position of the battery. Before the manufacturing process, a slim pre-buried sensor is utilized to reduce the negative impacts of different constant charge and discharge powers. The maximum internal temperature of the battery is up to 77 °C at a constant charge and discharge power of 896 W. The temperature difference between the two poles and the battery surface is as high as 26.2 °C, which is beyond the safety temperature (55 °C). This phenomenon will result in the degradation of the positive electrode through dQ/dV curves. These measurements of battery internal temperature can improve battery heat control and facilitate the development of energy storage technology. Full article"

However, the intrinsic reductive mechanism through which LiDFTFSI influences battery performance remains unclear and under debate. Herein, detailed SEI reactions of LiDFTFSI–based electrolytes were investigated by combining density functional theory and molecular dynamics, aiming to clarify the formation process and atomic structure of the SEI. Our results show that asymmetric DFTFSI − weakens the interaction between carbonate solvents and Li + , and substantially alters the solvation structure, exhibiting a well-balanced coordination capacity compared to bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI − ). Nanosecond hybrid molecular dynamics simulation further reveals that preferential decomposition of LiDFTFSI produces sufficient LiF and Li 2 O to facilitate a robust SEI. Moreover, abundant F − generated from LiDFTFSI decomposition accumulates on the Al surface and subsequently combines with Al 3+ from the current collector to form AlF 3 , potentially inhibiting corrosion of the current collector.

Therefore, a new method for lithium selective extraction from spent lithium-ion battery cathode materials is proposed, aiming at more efficient recovery of valuable metals. The acid + oxidant leaching system was proposed for spent ternary positive electrode materials, which can achieve the selective and efficient extraction of lithium. In this study, 0.1 mol L −1 H 2 SO 4 and 0.2 mol L −1 (NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 were used as leaching acid and oxidant.

Thermodynamic and kinetic studies of the lithium leaching process revealed that the apparent activation energy of the lithium leaching process is 46 kJ mol −1 and the rate step is the chemical reaction process. The leaching residue can be used as a ternary precursor to prepare regenerated positive electrode materials by solid-phase sintering. Electrochemical tests of the regenerated material proved that the material has good electrochemical properties. The highest discharge capacity exceeds 150 mAh g −1 at 0.2 C, and the capacity retention rate after 100 cycles exceeds 90%.

Herein, a strategy for engineering a dense ZnO coating layer on Zn anodes using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique is developed, aiming to improve its long-term cycling stability with fewer Zn dendrites. The surface-modified Zn anode (ZnO@Zn) exhibits an excellent long-cycling life (680 h) and stable coulombic efficiency when being used in a symmetric cell. Moreover, the ZnO@Zn electrode shows a high stability with almost no capacity decay after 1100 cycles at 2C in a full cell using MnO 2 as the cathode. The ZnO coating is conducive to reducing corrosion and the generation of by-products, thus increasing the reversibility of Zn 2+ /Zn stripping/plating.

To integrate them in high-efficiency modules, systematic methodologies are required to estimate the state of charge in a reliable way and predict the Li-V 2 O 5 battery’s performance according to their electrochemical phenomena, including two plateaus in the galvanostatic cycling curves and the dynamic behavior governed by the energy demand. Most state of charge estimation and battery modeling procedures are focused on conventional Li-batteries that show a unique plateau. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology based on the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to study battery performance in the time and frequency domains, respectively. The proposed methodology, with a time–frequency correlation, promotes a deeper understanding of the electrochemical phenomena and general behavior of Li-V 2 O 5 batteries, allowing for its subsequent extrapolation to more complex and higher-capacity lithium and post-lithium batteries used in high-power applications with a minimum error.

Among other critical functionalities, BMSs provide information about the key states of the batteries under usage, including state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH). This paper proposes a data-driven approach for the joint online estimation of SOC and SOH utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) approaches, particularly highlighting cross-stitch units and cross-stitch networks.

In this work, an aqueous mixture of glycolic and lactic acid is shown as an excellent leaching agent to recover these critical metals from spent Li-ion laptop batteries combined with cathode and anode coatings without adding hydrogen peroxide or other reducing agents. An aqueous acid mixture of 0.15 M in glycolic and 0.35 M in lactic acid showed the highest leaching efficiencies of 100, 100, 100, and 89% for Li, Ni, Mn, and Co, respectively, in an experiment at 120 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the chelate solution was evaporated to give a mixed metal-hydroxy acid chelate gel. Pyrolysis of the dried chelate gel at 800 °C for 15 h could be used to burn off hydroxy acids, regenerating lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, and the novel method presented to avoid the precipitation of metals as hydroxide or carbonates. The Li, Ni, Mn, and Co ratio of regenerated lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide is comparable to this metal ratio in pyrolyzed electrode coating and showed similar powder X-ray diffractograms, suggesting the suitability of α-hydroxy carboxylic acid mixtures as leaching agents and ligands in regeneration of mixed metal oxide via pyrolysis of the dried chelate gel.

Influence of the Nitrogen Precursor in the Development of N-Functionalities in a Mesoporous Carbon Material and Its Effect on the Li–S Cells’ Electrochemistry,"Carolina Mejía Salazar, Julián Acevedo, Jennifer Laverde, Diana López",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060169,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/6/169/pdf?version=1716277070,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/6/169,2,"Li–S batteries are positioned as a strong alternative for efficient energy storage due to their high theoretical energy density and their theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g −1 ) compared to current Li-ion batteries; however, their commercialization is affected by the rapid decay of the specific capacity as a consequence of the different species of lithium polysulfides that are generated during the charge–discharge processes. The use of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon materials has been shown to have the ability to confer electronic conductivity to sulfur and retain the lithium polysulfide species. However, there are not enough studies to help understand how the type of nitrogen precursor influences the development of specific nitrogen functionalities to favor the retention of lithium polysulfide species. This work seeks to determine the effect of the use of different nitrogen precursors on the structural changes of the mesoporous carbon materials prepared, and thus evaluate the electrochemical behavior of Li–S cells correlating the type of nitrogen functionality generated when the precursor is variated with the charge/discharge capacity developed during the cell operation. For this study, different carbon materials were prepared by the variation of the nitrogen source (melamine, ethylenediamine, and hexadecylamine) to obtain a N-doped mesoporous carbon with different distributions of nitrogen functionalities in its structure. The use of the primary amine ethylenediamine as a nitrogen precursor in the formation of structured carbon materials favored elemental sulfur infiltration into its pores, resulting in the maximum sulfur content within the pores and interacting with the carbonaceous matrix (78.8 wt.%). The carbon material prepared with this precursor resulted in a higher content of N-pyridinic functionality, which, combined with the high content of N-pyrrolic, resulted in the highest specific discharge capacity at 0.1 C after 100 cycles when compared to cells assembled with materials derived from the use of melamine and hexadecylamine precursors. The cell assembled with the electrode formed from ethylenediamine as a nitrogen precursor presented an initial discharge capacity of 918 mA h g −1 with a Coulombic efficiency of ~83.4% at 0.1 C after 100 cycles.

Mechanical abuse has been considered one of the major sources of LIB failure due to the changes it provokes in the structural integrity of cells. Therefore, this article aims to review the main factors that aggravate the effects of mechanical loading based on the results of different laboratory tests that subjected LIBs to abusive testing. The results of different cell types tested under different mechanical loadings have been gathered in order to assess the changes in LIB properties and the main mechanisms responsible for their failure and permanent damage. The main consequences of mechanical abuse are the increase in LIB degradation and the formation of events such as internal short circuits (ISCs) and thermal runways (TRs). Then, a set of standards and regulations that evaluate the LIB under mechanical abuse conditions are also reviewed. Full article"

The shunt currents model of the battery has been developed through the use of Kirchoff’s laws, taking into account the different design cases that can occur and enumerating the equations of nodes and meshes specifying them so that the software implementation can be performed in a direct way. The hydraulic model has been developed by numerical methods. These models are put to work simultaneously in order to simulate the behavior of a VRFB battery during charging and discharging, obtaining the pressure losses and shunt currents that occur in the battery. Using these models, and by using a PSO-type optimization algorithm, specifically designed for discrete variables, the battery design is optimized in order to minimize the round-trip efficiency losses due to pressure losses and shunt currents. In the optimization of the battery design, value is given to the number of stacks in which the total number of cells in the battery is distributed and the dimensions of the piping relative to both the stacks and the cells.

Selective Separation of Lithium from Leachate of Spent Lithium-Ion Batteries by Zirconium Phosphate/Polyacrylonitrile Composite: Leaching and Sorption Behavior,"Baffa Haruna, Zhongyan Luo, Mujtaba Aminu Muhammad, Jinfeng Tang, Jukka Kuva, Risto Koivula, Hongli Bao, Junhua Xu",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10070254,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/254/pdf?version=1721209485,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/254,4,"This study introduces a straightforward and effective amorphous ZrP/polyacrylonitrile composite ion exchange method for separating Li from the leachate of spent Li-ion batteries (NMC 111). The cathode materials were leached with a series of optimized experiments. The influence of operating variables, including the H 2 SO 4 concentration, temperature, H 2 O 2 concentration, and pulp density, on leaching efficiency was examined to determine the optimal conditions for sorption experiments. The leaching efficiencies of Li, Co, Ni, and Mn were found to be 99.9%, 99.5%, 98.8%, and 99.9%, respectively. Subsequently, batch sorption experiments were performed by using am-ZrP/PAN, including the determination of the effect of pH, sorption kinetics, and the sorption isotherm. The effect of pH on adsorption was examined in 1 mmol/L equimolar solutions of Li, Ni, Mn, and Co. Li was separated from Mn, Co, and Ni in the leaching liquor. The adsorbent for Mn, Co, and Ni sorption better fitted pseudo-second-order kinetics. High selectivity for Li was observed, even at the higher solution concentration of 15 mM Li, Ni, Co and Mn. In addition, the column loading process demonstrated selectivity for Li over Co, Ni, and Mn metal ions. The preliminary evaluation of the whole process with mass flow demonstrated that it would be feasible to achieve full separation and metal recovery by integrating a combined hydrometallurgical method in future studies. However, much work is still needed to develop a practical separation flowsheet. Full article"

The formation of a Li-rich alloy is confirmed by the volume expansion (up to 380%) of the layer and by the disappearance of metallic Sn peaks in the X-ray diffractogram. The layer has a much higher hardness than bare Li and can withstand aggressive cycling at 1C. Post-mortem scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the alloy layer remains intact even after fast cycling for hundreds of cycles. A concept of double modification by adding a thin ceramic/polymer layer deposited by a doctor blade on top of the Li x Sn y layer was also reported to be efficient to reach long-term stability for 500 cycles at C/3. Finally, a post-treatment after Sn deposition consisting of a plasma cleaning of the Li x Sn y alloy layer led to a strong improvement in the cycling performance at 1C. The surface is smoother and less oxidized after this treatment. The combination of a Li-rich alloy interlayer, the increase in hardness at the electrolyte/Li interface, and the absence of dissolution of the layer during cycling at high C-rates are reasons for such an improvement in electrochemical performance.

This study investigates the potential revenue from optimal battery scheduling for residential storage in different north-western European electricity price zones during 2023. Using Nord Pool day-ahead prices, we applied an optimization model to determine the revenue for two types of batteries: 5 kW/10 kWh and 10 kW/10 kWh. The analysis considered battery capacity, charging and discharging efficiency, and maximum charge/discharge rates. Our results show notable variations in potential revenue across different regions, with the Baltic states demonstrating the highest revenue potential. The findings indicate that while 10 kW batteries can generate higher total revenue, 5 kW batteries are more efficient in terms of revenue per cycle. These regional disparities underscore the need for targeted incentives and policies to enhance the economic viability of residential energy storage. The research results provide valuable insights into optimizing residential battery storage for price arbitrage, offering guidance for consumers, policymakers, and energy providers to maximize economic benefits in various electricity markets.

This work proposes and describes an electrochemical model of a Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO) and Ni-rich NMC-based lithium cell with a deformable lithium negative electrode. Simulations were computed using the finite element method at different operating conditions to demonstrate the scope of the modeling work. Discharge rate tests, deformation tracking, geometric defect investigation, and polarization decomposition are described. Theoretical validation of the mass balance, the stripping rate, the ohmic polarization, and the mesh deformation demonstrated the consistency of the volumetric deformation strategy. We demonstrated in this study a deformable modeling strategy, which was found to be useful for the electrostripping analysis of anodic geometry defects during discharge. Non-uniformity in the lithium stripping rate was found along the anodic interface with defects, and this non-uniformity was accentuated with a higher discharge rate. The cell’s discharge potential was decomposed by considering the equilibrium potential and the polarizations of the main components of the cell. This post-processing was found to be useful for the understanding of the cell’s behavior. Full article"

The Li 2 CO 3 layer, which we show forms on the surface of garnets within 3 min of exposure to ambient moisture and CO 2 , increases the interface (surface) resistance of LLZTO. The plasma treatment is carried out entirely in ambient and is enabled by use of a custom-built metal shroud that is placed around the plasma nozzle to prevent moisture and CO 2 from reacting with the sample. After the plasma treatment, N 2 compressed gas is flowed through the shroud to cool the sample and prevent atmospheric species from reacting with the LLZTO. We demonstrate that this approach is effective for removing the Li 2 CO 3 from the surface of LLZTO. The surface chemistry is characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to evaluate the effect of process parameters (plasma exposure time and shroud gas chemistry) on removal of the surface species. We also show that the open-air plasma treatment can significantly reduce the interface resistance. This platform demonstrates a path towards open-air processed solid-state batteries. Full article"

The main goal of the tests is to determine how the cell capacity varies with the temperature and the discharge current to predict the open-circuit voltage of the cell and its entropic component. A simple approach for the characterization of the battery equivalent electrical circuit and a two-step thermal characterization method are also shown. The investigations are carried out on four commercial 18650 NMC lithium cells. The model was shown to predict the battery voltage with an RMS error lower than 20 mV and the temperature with an RMS error equal to 0.5 °C.

Impedance spectra of high-energy Panasonic NCR18650B batteries have been analysed in light of two distinct approaches, namely the time-dependent evaluation of the Constant Phase Element (CPE), and the single parameter investigation of resonance frequency of the circuit. SOH percentages were used to validate our approach. By monitoring the CPE-Q parameter at different charge rates of 0.5 C, 1 C, and 1.5 C, respectively, we applied a degradation speed analysis, allowing us to predict a quantitative value of the LIBs. The results are in complete agreement with the resonance frequency single parameter analysis, in which quite a similar trend was obtained after the spline fitting. Full article"

Thermal oxidation is one of the simplest used methods to obtain nanowires on a metal surface, offering advantages such as low production costs and the ability to produce metal oxides on a large scale without the use of hazardous chemical compounds. The growth of metal oxides on a conductive substrate, forming metal/oxide structures, has proven to be an effective method for enhancing charge-transfer efficiency. The as-synthesized Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO (Nw) electrodes were structurally and morphologically characterized using techniques such as XRD and SEM/EDX analysis to investigate the structure modification and morphologies of the materials. The supercapacitor properties of the as-developed Cu/Cu 2 O/CuO (Nw) electrodes were then examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

The assessment of the flexibility of the electrodes was performed at various bending angles, including 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°. The GCD analysis revealed a maximum specific capacitance of 21.198 mF cm −2 at a low power density of 0.5 mA cm −2 for the oxidation temperature of 300 °C.

The reason is a small contribution of the drift current due to field screening by the electric double layer. The basis for this assumption is the measurement of the LiPON absorption capacitance, according to which its dielectric constant is about 10 6 . An alternative equivalent circuit containing a non-ideal absorption element is proposed and its impedance is calculated. It is shown that the Bode diagrams of the alternative circuit approximate the experimental curves well. Parameters and the magnitude of electric field screening are calculated based on a proposed model of a double electric layer.

The adhesion between aluminum and the polymer film is improved through the application of a surface treatment agent to the aluminum surface. This study examines the initial adhesive strength of a manufactured pouch film with respect to the drying temperature and time and evaluates its adhesive strength in the presence of moisture. The results indicate that the residual moisture on the aluminum surface weakens the adhesive strength and significantly affects electrolyte resistance. A noticeable reduction in strength was observed after water spraying, when the drying temperature and time were relatively low during the initial strength measurement. Among the adhesives used for aluminum and CPP lamination, olefin adhesives exhibit less susceptibility to electrolyte effects and have higher adhesive strengths compared to urethane and ester adhesives. Leveraging these characteristics, flexible pouch cells were manufactured and their stability was evaluated. The results confirm that the flexible cells demonstrate excellent stability, exhibiting potential for application in wearable devices. Full article"
Experimental Investigation on Thermal Runaway of Lithium-Ion Batteries under Low Pressure and Low Temperature,"Di Meng, Jingwen Weng, Jian Wang",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10070243,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/243/pdf?version=1721113911,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/243,13,"Understanding the thermal runaway mechanism of lithium-ion batteries under low pressure and low temperature is paramount for their application and transportation in the aviation industry. This work investigated the coupling effects of ambient pressure (100 kPa, 70 kPa, 40 kPa) and ambient temperature (−15 °C, 0 °C, 25 °C) on thermal behaviors in an altitude temperature chamber. The experimental results indicate that lowering ambient pressure and temperature could attenuate the thermal runaway intensity, which is mainly attributable to the reduction in oxygen concentration and the increase in heat loss. Such a dual effect leads to the maximum temperature decreasing from 811.9 °C to 667.5 °C, and the maximum temperature rate declines up to 2.6 times. Correspondingly, the whole thermal runaway process is deferred, the total time increases from 370 s to 503 s, and the time interval, Δ t , from safety venting gains by 32.3% as the ambient pressure and temperature decrease. This work delivers an in-depth understanding of the thermal characteristics under low pressure and low temperature and provides meritorious guidance for the safety of cell transportation in aviation.

To better optimize the energy management problem of fuel cell hybrid systems, the accuracy of system modeling and simulation is very important. The hybrid system is formed by connecting the battery to the fuel cell through an active topology. Digital twin technology is applicable to the mapping of physical entities to each other with high interactivity and fast optimization iterations. In this paper, a relevant model based on mathematical logic is established by collecting actual operational data; subsequently, the accuracy of the model is verified by combining relevant operating conditions and simulating the model. Subsequently, a three-dimensional visualization model of a hybrid power system-based sightseeing vehicle and its operating environment was established using digital twin technology to improve the model simulation of the fuel cell hybrid power system. At low speeds, the simulation results of the hybrid power system-based sightseeing vehicle have a small error compared with the actual running state, and the accuracy of the data related to each internal subcomponent is high. In the simple interaction between the model display vehicle and the environment, the communication state can meet the basic requirements of the digital twin model because the amount of data to be transferred is small. This study makes a preliminary attempt at digital parallelism by combining mathematical logic with visualization models and can be used as a basis for the subsequent development of more mature digital twin models.

TR, a critical safety concern for LIBs, can occur under overheating conditions. The TR behavior of LIBs was characterized by flame behavior, temperature characteristics, mass variation, jet dynamics, and residue formations. The results reveal that the heating power density primarily influences the time to initiate TR. Lower power densities extend the heating time and require higher energy to induce TR, thereby exerting a more considerable impact on the battery. The heating area predominantly affects the input energy and the extent of damage. Larger areas lead to more stable jet flames, consistent peak temperatures ranging between 1000 °C and 1300 °C, and mass loss ratios ranging from 44% to 53% compared to 43% to 47% for small-area heaters. These findings provide references for the safety design of battery assemblies and the prevention of TR propagation, contributing to the safer monitoring of LIBs. Full article"

However, this approach is not suitable for batteries, such as the vanadium flow battery (VFB), due to its technical complexity. The presented model primarily focuses on VFBs, as a deep technical understanding is identified as a fundamental prerequisite for a comprehensive CE analysis. Based on the R-strategies, a new model called the dynamic multi-dimensional value retention strategy model (DDS) is developed accordingly. The DDS divides the R-strategies into three dimensions, as changes in the studied object each have a unilateral influence on the underlying dimensions. In addition, interactions among the R-strategies within the dimensions are observed. Moreover, the model enables the transparent and comprehensible examination of various CE objective factors. Through the model, future adjustments to CE for batteries can be analyzed and quantified. In particular, the analysis yields new insights into individual end-of-life (EoL) strategies, based on new findings regarding the VFB. Consequently, important new perspectives on the VFB are also illuminated. The DDS model is applicable to other complex technologies as well as simple product systems. Full article"

It brings convenience to their travels, but it also causes energy shortages and environmental pollution. With the development of science and technology and the popularization of green environmental protection, electric vehicles have gradually entered people’s lives, greatly alleviating these problems. As a power supply device for electric vehicles, the performance of batteries directly affects various indicators of vehicles.

Therefore, attempts are being made to reduce it by various means. One of the most important sources of pollution in terms of the current RoHS and REACH directives is the pollution caused by the use of chemical products for the production of sources for the storage and generation of electricity. The aim of this article is therefore to develop supercapacitors made of biodegradable materials and to investigate their electrical performance. Among the materials used to make these electrodes, activated carbon was identified as the main material and different combinations of gelatin, calligraphy ink and glycerol were used as the binders. The electrolyte consists of a hydrogel based on gelatin, NaCl 20 wt% solution and glycerol. In the context of this research, the electrolyte, which has the consistency of a gel, fulfills the dual function of the separator in the structure of the manufactured cells. Due to its structure, the electrolyte has good mechanical properties and can easily block the contact between the two electrodes. Most of the materials used for the production of supercapacitor cells are interchangeable materials, which are mainly used in other application fields such as the food or cosmetics industries, but were also successfully used for the investigations carried out in this research. Thus, remarkable results were recorded regarding a specific capacitance between 101.46 F/g and 233.26 F/g and an energy density between 3.52 Wh/kg and 8.09 Wh/kg, with a slightly lower power density between 66.66 W/kg and 85.76 W/kg for the manufactured supercapacitors.

Incorrectly discarded Li-ion cells from SUVs can suffer mechanical damage, potentially leading to thermal runaway (TR) depending on the cells’ state of charge (SOC). Industry-standard abuse tests (short-circuit and nail test) and novel impact and crush tests, simulating damage during waste management processes, were conducted on Li-ion cells from two market-leading SUVs. The novel tests created internal short circuits, generating higher temperatures than the short-circuit test required for product safety. The cells in used SUVs had an average SOC ≤ 50% and reached a maximum temperature of 131 °C, below the minimum ignition temperature of common waste materials. The high temperatures were short-lived and had limited heat transfer to adjacent materials. The study concludes that Li-ion cells in used SUVs at ≤50% SOC cannot generate sufficient heat and temperature to ignite common waste and recycling materials. These findings have implications for understanding the fire risk associated with discarded SUVs in waste management facilities. Full article"

Through structural and performance characterization, it was found that the catalyst has a high specific surface area and good CO catalytic oxidation capability, with a CO removal rate higher than 99.97% at room temperature. Through electrical performance testing, it was discovered that, compared to batteries without the catalyst, batteries using the composite anode did not exhibit significant capacity degradation. In overcharge testing, the catalyst prolonged the voltage rise time and peak voltage occurrence time of the battery. In thermal runaway testing, the addition of the catalyst delayed the detection time of CO and significantly reduced the concentration of thermal runaway products, especially the peak concentration and integrated concentration of CO, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing thermal runaway products. Therefore, this study provides a new approach for improving the safety of lithium-ion batteries. The catalyst exhibits good performance in reducing toxic gases generated after thermal runaway and delaying the occurrence of thermal runaway, providing strong support for the safe application of lithium-ion batteries.

The method introduces a ‘degradation function’ that is calculated with respect to the reference performance of pristine cells. The procedure was applied to the JuiceRoll Race Edition system, an innovative electric vehicle (EV) DC charger with internal storage, made in ENEL X and used during the MotoE championship races. Using this procedure, the degradation of performance in individual groups of cells composing the battery pack was quantified in comparison to the reference group.

Water mist (WM) is considered to have excellent cooling capacity and is widely used in the field of fire protection. When used in TR suppression, WM also exhibits strong fire-extinguishing and anti-re-ignition abilities. Therefore, it has received widespread attention and research interest among scholars. However, most studies have focused on the cooling rate and suppression effect of TR propagation, and few have mentioned the effect of WM on flame heat transfer, which is a significant index in TR propagation suppression. This study has explored the suppression effect of WM released at different TR stages and has analyzed flame temperature, heat release, and heat radiation under WM conditions. Results show that the flame extinguishing duration for WM under different TR stages was different. WM could directly put out the flame within several seconds of being released when SV opened, 3 min after SV opening and when TR ended, and 3 min for WM when TR was triggered. Moreover, the heat radiation of the flame in relation to the battery Q E could be calculated, and the case of WM released 3 min after SV opening exhibited the greatest proportion of heat radiation cooling η (with a value of 88.4%), which was same for the specific cooling capacity of WM Q m with a value of 1.7 × 10 −3 kJ/kg. This is expected to provide a novel focus for TR suppression in LIBs. Full article"

Commercial batteries cannot be disassembled, and the diffusion stress distribution at different times during discharge is notoriously difficult to determine. This paper, therefore, establishes the electrochemical force-coupling model based on the electrochemical and diffusion mechanics principles of batteries and studies the internal stress distribution of the battery under the diffusion stress of the electrode-material level and external pressure. Mainly driven by the electrochemical potential of the electrode particle diffusion stress stemming from the lithium-concentration difference inside and outside the particles, rupture is more likely to occur at the surface of the negative-electrode active particle at the end of discharge or the beginning of charging, as shown in simulation analysis. The variation in the volume of electrode material also leads to different stress and strain inside different areas, with the order of strain and stress being negative active material > negative collector fluid > positive active material > positive fluid. Therefore, huge stress and deformation will first cause the negative active particles to deviate from the fluid gradually and squeeze the diaphragm, resulting in mechanical failure accordingly.

This study incorporates the effects of battery degradation on the dynamics in the optimisation framework. Considering this cost in economic analysis and operational strategies is essential to optimise long-term performance and economic viability. Neglecting degradation costs can lead to suboptimal operation and dispatch strategies. We employ a continuous-time representation of the dynamics, in contrast with many other studies that use a discrete-time approximation with rather coarse intervals. We adopt an equivalent circuit model coupled with empirical degradation parameters to simulate a battery cell’s behaviour and degradation mechanisms with good support from experimental data. Utilising direct collocation methods with mesh refinement allows for precise numerical solutions to the complex, nonlinear dynamics involved. Through a detailed case study of Belgium’s day-ahead electricity market, we determine the optimal charging and discharging schedules under varying objectives: maximising net revenues, maximising profits considering capacity degradation, and maximising profits considering both capacity degradation and internal resistance increase due to degradation. The results demonstrate the viability of our approach and underscore the significance of integrating degradation costs into the market strategy for battery operators, alongside its effects on the battery’s dynamic behaviour. Our methodology extends previous work by offering a more comprehensive model that empirically captures the intricacies of battery degradation, including a fine and adaptive time domain representation, focusing on the day-ahead market, and utilising accurate direct methods for optimal control.

Integrating a DRL framework with an electrothermal model to estimate unmeasurable states, this strategy simultaneously manages battery degradation and thermal safety while maintaining safe following distances. Results from hardware-in-the-loop simulation testing demonstrated that this approach reduced overall driving costs by 18.72%, decreased battery temperatures by 4 °C to 8 °C in high-temperature environments, and reduced state-of-health (SOH) degradation by up to 46.43%.

The abundant availability of sodium at a low cost addresses concerns associated with lithium, such as environmental contamination and limited availability. However, SIBs exhibit lower energy density and cyclic stability compared to LIBs. One of the key challenges in improving the performance of SIBs lies in the electrochemical properties of the cathode materials. Among the various cathodes utilized in SIBs, sodium vanadium phosphates (NVPs) and sodium vanadium fluorophosphates (NVPFs) are particularly advantageous. These vanadium-based cathodes offer high theoretical capacity and are cost-effective. Commercialization of SIBs with NVPF cathodes has already begun. However, the poor conductivity of these cathode materials leads to a short cycle life and inferior rate performance. Various synthesis methods have been explored to enhance the conductivity, including heteroatom doping (N, S, and Co), surface modification, the fabrication of porous nanostructures, and composite formation with conductive carbon materials. In particular, cathodes with interconnected hierarchical micro- and nano-porous morphologies have shown promise. This review focuses on the diverse synthesis methods reported for preparing hierarchically porous cathodes. With increased attention, particular emphasis has been placed on carbon composites of NVPs and NVPFs. Additionally, the synthesis of vanadium pentoxide-based cathodes is also discussed. Full article"

However, the research on ZICs still faces many challenges because of the lack of appropriate cathode materials with robust crystal structures and rich channels for stable and fast Zn 2+ ion transport. In this study, we synthesized a robust, conductive, two-dimensional metal–organic framework (MOF) material, zinc-benzenehexathiolate (Zn-BHT), and investigated its electrochemical performance for zinc storage. Zn 2+ ions could insert into/extricate from the host structure with a high diffusion rate, enabling the Zn-BHT cathode to exhibit a surface-controlled charge storage mechanism. Due to its unique structure, Zn-BHT exhibited a good reversible discharge capacity approaching 90.4 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , as well as a desirable rate capability and good cycling performance. In addition, a ZIC device was fabricated using the Zn-BHT cathode and a polyaniline-derived porous carbon (PC) anode, which depicted a high working voltage of up to 1.8 V and a high energy density of ~37.2 Wh kg −1 . This work shows that conductive MOFs are high-potential electrode materials for ZICs and provide new enlightenment for the development of electrode materials for EES devices. Full article"
Extraction Strategies from Black Alloy Leachate: A Comparative Study of Solvent Extractants,"Namho Koo, Byungseon Kim, Hong-In Kim, Kyungjung Kwon",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10070221,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/221/pdf?version=1719141746,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/221,11,"Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial to prevent environmental pollution and recover valuable metals. Traditional methods for recycling spent LIBs include hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy. Among these methods, solvent extraction can selectively extract valuable metals in spent LIB leachate. Meanwhile, spent LIBs that underwent pyrometallurgical treatment generate a so-called ‘black alloy’ of Ni, Co, Cu, and so on. These elements in the black alloy need to be separated by solvent extraction and there have been few studies on extracting valuable metals from black alloy. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the extraction behavior of elements in black alloy and optimize the solvent extraction process to recover valuable metals. In this paper, four types of organic extractants are used to extract metals from simulated black alloy leachate: di-(2ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex272), 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (PC88A), and neodecanoic acid (Versatic acid 10). Based on the pH isotherms, D2EHPA would be the most reasonable for Mn extraction and impurity removal. Cyanex 272 would be more suitable for Co separation than PC88A, and Versatic acid 10 is preferred for Cu extraction over other metals. In conclusion, the optimal combination of extractants is suggested for the recovery of valuable metals. Full article"

Robust Online Estimation of State of Health for Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on Capacities under Dynamical Operation Conditions,"Xiaoxuan Wu, Jian Chen, Hu Tang, Ke Xu, Mingding Shao, Yu Long",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10070219,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/219/pdf?version=1721204968,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/219,7,"Lithium-ion batteries, as the main energy storage component of electric vehicles (EVs), play a crucial role in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the battery systems through monitoring their state of health (SOH). However, temperature variations and battery aging have significant impacts on the internal parameters of lithium-ion batteries, and these changes directly correlate with the accuracy of battery SOH estimation. To address these issues, this paper proposes an estimation method for lithium-ion battery SOH that considers the impact of temperature. The method begins with reconstructing a second-order hybrid equivalent circuit model for lithium-ion batteries, through which an adaptive update rate for battery model parameters is designed. On this basis, a nonlinear observer for battery states is introduced by integrating filters to estimate SOH. The proposed method considers the impact of capacity in the design of the parameter adaptive update rate, enabling the capacity to be dynamically adjusted based on the actual state of the batteries. This reduces the cumulative error in the SOC observer and improves the modeling accuracy of battery models. Experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper exhibits exceptional performance in SOH estimation under different temperature conditions. The mean absolute error for SOH estimation does not exceed 0.5%, and the root mean square error does not exceed 0.2%. This method can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of SOH, providing a more efficient and accurate solution for battery management systems in EVs. Full article"
Development of a Process for Direct Recycling of Negative Electrode Scrap from Lithium-Ion Battery Production on a Technical Scale and Its Influence on the Material Quality,"Patrick Wiechers, Anna Hermann, Sofia Koob, Fabian Glaum, Marco Gleiß",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10070218,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/218/pdf?version=1733983705,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/218,6,"High production rates and the constant expansion of production capacities for lithium-ion batteries will lead to large quantities of production waste in the future. The desired achievement of a circular economy presupposes that such rejects could be recovered. This paper presents a two-staged process route that allows one to recover graphite and conductive carbon black from already coated negative electrode foils in a water-based and function-preserving manner, and it makes it directly usable as a particle suspension for coating new negative electrodes. In a first step, coating residues, which accumulate in production (as offcuts or rejects for example), are decoated in an aqueous ultrasonic bath. The ultrasonic bath also serves as a pre-thickener. As a result, high mass concentrations of active material can already be achieved in the water after the first process step. Water is then removed from the negative electrode suspension in a subsequent step by applying dynamic cross-flow filtration. With this unit operation, it is possible to concentrate the slurry residue to a solid content similar to that of the new electrode slurries used for coatings. An important criterion for the direct utilization of production waste is that the particle properties are affected as little as possible so that the suspension can be used directly for coating new films. This work presents the individual recycling process steps and their influence on the particle and slurry properties. The aim is to assess whether the recyclate is suitable for a coating of new negative electrodes and thus also for manufacturing batteries from 100% recycled material. Full article"
Fault Diagnosis for Lithium-Ion Battery Pack Based on Relative Entropy and State of Charge Estimation,"Tian-E Fan, Fan Chen, Hao-Ran Lei, Xin Tang, Fei Feng",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10070217,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/217/pdf?version=1718950025,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/7/217,5,"Timely and accurate fault diagnosis for a lithium-ion battery pack is critical to ensure its safety. However, the early fault of a battery pack is difficult to detect because of its unobvious fault effect and nonlinear time-varying characteristics. In this paper, a fault diagnosis method based on relative entropy and state of charge (SOC) estimation is proposed to detect fault in lithium-ion batteries. First, the relative entropies of the voltage, temperature and SOC of battery cells are calculated by using a sliding window, and the cumulative sum (CUSUM) test is adopted to achieve fault diagnosis and isolation. Second, the SOC estimation of the short-circuit cell is obtained, and the short-circuit resistance is estimated for a quantitative analysis of the short-circuit fault. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method is validated by multiple fault tests in a thermally coupled electrochemical battery model. The results show that the proposed method can accurately detect different types of faults and evaluate the short-circuit fault degree by resistance estimation. The voltage/temperature sensor fault is detected at 71 s/58 s after faults have occurred, and a short-circuit fault is diagnosed at 111 s after the fault. In addition, the standard error deviation of short-circuit resistance estimation is less than 0.12 Ω/0.33 Ω for a 5 Ω/10 Ω short-circuit resistor. Full article"

Battery energy storage systems provide power during peak times, alleviating grid stress and reducing the necessity for grid upgrades. By 2030, one of the proposed capacity development scenarios on the island involves deploying large-scale lithium-ion batteries to better manage the integration of solar generation. This paper focuses on the life cycle assessment and life cycle costing of a lithium iron phosphate large-scale battery energy storage system in Lombok to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of this battery development scenario. This analysis considers a cradle-to-grave model and defines 10 environmental and 4 economic midpoint indicators to assess the impact of battery energy storage system integration with Lombok’s grid across manufacturing, operation, and recycling processes. From a life cycle assessment perspective, the operation subsystem contributes most significantly to global warming, while battery manufacturing is responsible for acidification, photochemical ozone formation, human toxicity, and impacts on marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Recycling processes notably affect freshwater due to their release of 4.69 × 10 −4 kg of lithium. The life cycle costing results indicate that over 85% of total costs are associated with annualized capital costs at a 5% discount rate. The levelized cost of lithium iron phosphate batteries for Lombok is approximately 0.0066, demonstrating that lithium-ion batteries are an economically viable option for Lombok’s 2030 capacity development scenario. A sensitivity analysis of input data and electricity price fluctuations confirms the reliability of our results within a 20% margin of error. Moreover, increasing electricity prices for battery energy storage systems in Lombok can reduce the payback period to 3.5 years. Full article"

Lithium polysulfide shuttling and lithium dendrite growth have limited their commercialization. Porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) separators have shown improved performance (relative to hydrocarbon separators) in lithium-ion batteries due to faster lithium-ion migration and higher Li + transference number. A thin polar PVDF membrane has now been fabricated via phase inversion (an immersion-precipitation method) yielding a β (polar) phase concentration of 72%. Preparation from commercial PVDF used dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent at the optimized crystallizing temperature of 70 °C, and pores in the membrane were generated by exchange of DMF with deionized water as non-solvent. The polar PVDF film produced has the advantages of being ultrathin (15 µm), lightweight (1.15 mg cm −2 ), of high porosity (75%) and high wettability (84%), and it shows enhanced thermal stability relative to polypropylene (PP). The porous, polar PVDF membrane was combined with a commercially available PP membrane to give a hybrid, two-layer, separator combination for LSBs. A synergy was created in the two-layer separator, providing high sulfur utilization and curbing polysulfide shuttling. The electrochemical performance with the hybrid separator (PP–β-PVDF) was evaluated in LSB cells and showed good cyclability and rate capability: those LSB cells showed a stable capacity of 750 mA h g −1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, much higher than that for otherwise-identical cells using a commercial PP-only separator (480 mA h g −1 ).

We discuss the Autoregressive one-step prediction framework and introduce an innovative one-time multi-step (OTMS) prediction approach, based on a custom loss function, that predicts all future steps in a single shot. The presented methodologies are then applied to simultaneously predict the State of Health (SoH) trajectory and estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion battery cells. Accurate estimates of SoH trajectory and RUL are essential for Battery Management Systems (BMSs), electronic systems that guarantee safety while maximizing performance and extending battery lifespan. In this context, the studied methodologies were compared using a rigorous cross-validation approach. The OTMS model showed better predictions in early cycles, while the Autoregressive model performed better in later cycles, suggesting a hybrid approach between these two methodologies as an optimal solution.

After convergence, the observation error signal of the current node in the cascade observer is generated from the output injection signal of the previous node’s observer. The current node’s observer generates its output injection signal, leading to its convergence. This sequential process accurately determines the observed values of each node using only the battery’s current and voltage. Subsequently, the SoC and SoH are estimated using observations of lithium-ion concentrations on the surface and inside the battery anode. The accuracy of this approach is validated using Dynamic Stress Test (DST) and Federal Urban Driving Scheme (FUDS) experimental data. A comparative analysis with conventional SMO and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithms demonstrates the approach’s effectiveness and superior performance, confirming its practical applicability.

This study investigates the thermal runaway characteristics of LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) 18650 LIBs at different states of charge (SOCs) (75%, 100%) under various ambient pressures (101 kPa, 80 kPa, 60 kPa, 40 kPa). The results show that, as the pressure is decreased from 101 kPa to 40 kPa, the onset time of thermal runaway is extended by 28.2 s for 75% SOC and by 40.8 s for 100% SOC; accordingly, the onset temperature of thermal runaway increases by 19.3 °C for 75% SOC and by 33.5 °C for 100% SOC; the maximum surface temperature decreases by 70.8 °C for 75% SOC and by 68.2 °C for 100% SOC. The cell mass loss and loss rate slightly decrease with reduced pressure. However, ambient pressure has little impact on the time and temperature of venting as well as the voltage drop time. SEM/EDS analysis verifies that electrolyte evaporates faster under low pressure. Furthermore, the oxygen concentration is lower under low pressure, which consequently leads to a delay in thermal runaway.

Both directly measured and computationally derived features are extracted from the charge/discharge curves to simulate real-world fast-charging conditions. This comprehensive process captures the complex dynamics of battery behavior effectively. The TFMN method utilizes one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1DCNNs) to capture local features, refined further by a channel self-attention module (CSAM) for robust SOH prediction. Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules process these features to capture long-term dependencies essential for understanding evolving battery health patterns. A multi-head attention module enhances the model by learning varied feature representations, significantly improving SOH estimation accuracy. Validated on a self-constructed dataset and the public Toyota dataset, the model demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness, improving performance by 30–50% compared to other models. This approach not only refines SOH estimation under fast-charging conditions but also offers new insights for effective battery management and maintenance, advancing battery health monitoring technologies.

Powell",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10080283,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/283/pdf?version=1723112691,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/283,5,"Lithium–ion battery development necessitates predicting capacity fading using early cycle data to minimize testing time and costs. This study introduces a hybrid physics–guided data–driven approach to address this challenge by accurately determining the dominant fading mechanism and predicting the average capacity fading rate. Physics–guided features, derived from the electrochemical properties and behaviors within the battery, are extracted from the first five cycles to provide meaningful, interpretable, and predictive data. Unlike previous models that rely on a single regression approach, our method utilizes two separate regression models tailored to the identified dominant fading mechanisms. Our model achieves 95.6% accuracy in determining the dominant fading mechanism using data from the second cycle and a mean absolute percentage error of 17.09% in predicting lifetime capacity fade from the first five cycles. This represents a substantial improvement over state–of–the–art models, which have an error rate approximately three times higher. This study underscores the significance of physics–guided data characterization and the necessity of identifying the primary fading mechanism prior to predicting the capacity fading rate in lithium–ion batteries.

Study on Thermal Runaway Behavior and Jet Characteristics of a 156 Ah Prismatic Ternary Lithium Battery,Huipeng Zhang,2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10080282,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/282/pdf?version=1724823280,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/282,8,"Ternary lithium batteries have been widely used in transportation and energy storage due to their high energy density and long cycle life. However, safety issues arising from thermal runaway (TR) need urgent resolution. Current research on thermal runaway in large-capacity ternary lithium batteries is limited, making the study of hazard indicators during the thermal runaway ejection process crucial. This study places a commercial 156 Ah prismatic battery (positive electrode material: Li(Ni 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 )O 2 , negative electrode material: graphite) in a nitrogen-filled sealed container, triggering thermal runaway through lateral heating. The experimental results show that the battery’s maximum surface temperature can reach 851.8–943.7 °C, exceeding the melting point of aluminum. Temperature surge inflection points at the battery’s bottom and near the small side of the negative electrode coincide with the inflection point on the heated surface. The highest jet temperatures at three monitoring points 50 mm, 150 mm, and 250 mm above the safety valve are 356.9 °C, 302.7 °C, and 216.5 °C, respectively. Acoustic signals reveal two ejection events. The average gas production of the battery is 0.089 mol/Ah, and the jet undergoes three stages: ultra-fast ejection (2 s), rapid ejection (32 s), and slow ejection (47 s). Post-thermal runaway remnants indicate that grooves from internal jet impacts are mainly located at ±45° positions. This study provides valuable insights for the safety design of batteries and the suppression of thermal runaway propagation. Full article"
Water Effect on the Electronic Properties and Lithium-Ion Conduction in a Defect-Engineered LiFePO4Electrode,"Guoqing Wang, Pengfei Xu, Halefom G.

However, the effects of defect-engineering on ion conduction and its mechanisms in humid environments remain unclear in the academic discourse. Here, we report on the effect of vacancy defects on the electronic properties of and Li-ion diffusion in a LiFePO 4 material in humid environments. The research findings indicate that vacancy defects reduce the lattice constant and unit cell volume of LiFePO 4 . Additionally, the water molecules occupy the Li-ion vacancies, leading to an increase in the lattice constant of LiFePO 4 . The computational results of the electronic properties show that the introduction of water molecules induces a transition in LiFePO 4 from a semiconductor to a metallic behavior, with a transfer of 0.38 e of charge from the water molecules to LiFePO 4 . Additionally, the migration barrier for Li ions in the H 2 O + LiFePO 4 system is found to be 0.50 eV, representing an 11.1% increase compared to the pristine LiFePO 4 migration barrier. Our findings suggest that water molecules impede the migration of Li ions and provide important insights into the effect of defect-engineering on electronic properties and ion conduction under humid conditions.

Sustainable Battery Lifecycle: Non-Destructive Separation of Batteries and Potential Second Life Applications,"Gernot Schlögl, Stefan Grollitsch, Christian Ellersdorfer, Florian Feist, Christoph Kirschner, Josef Ecker, Franz Haas",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10080280,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/280/pdf?version=1722913501,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/280,4,"Large quantities of battery systems will be discarded from electric vehicles in the future. Non-destructive separation of used electric vehicle (EV) traction batteries enables a second life of battery components, extraction of high value secondary materials, and reduces the environmental footprint of recycling and separation processes. In this study, the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the second life application of spent EV batteries are identified. Three battery packs are analyzed in terms of the joining techniques used—and possible separation techniques—considering only direct recycling methods. The components that can be recovered from these batteries are evaluated against the KPIs. This study shows that all the batteries analyzed allow a second life in stationary and semi-stationary electrical storage systems and marine applications when used at the pack and module levels. Two packs can be reused in electric vehicles such as forklifts. However, the feasibility of re-use in micro-mobility and consumer electronics is very limited. This study shows that technically feasible separation methods are dictated and constrained by the joining techniques used. As welding and adhesive bonding pose challenges to separation processes, future efforts should prioritize ‘design for disassembly’ to ensure sustainable battery life cycle management. Full article"
Comparative Issues of Metal-Ion Batteries toward Sustainable Energy Storage: Lithium vs. Sodium,"Atiyeh Nekahi, Mehrdad Dorri, Mina Rezaei, Mohamed Djihad Bouguern, Anil Kumar Madikere Raghunatha Reddy, Xia Li, Sixu Deng, Karim Zaghib",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10080279,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/279/pdf?version=1722837032,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/279,38,"In recent years, batteries have revolutionized electrification projects and accelerated the energy transition. Consequently, battery systems were hugely demanded based on large-scale electrification projects, leading to significant interest in low-cost and more abundant chemistries to meet these requirements in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). As a result, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) share has increased considerably due to lower cost and higher safety compared to conventional nickel and cobalt-based chemistries. However, their fast-growing share is affected by updated chemistries, where cheaper systems like sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are becoming more attractive. SIBs also benefited from the greener, more ethical, and evenly distributed elemental resources. SIBs are fast approaching market thanks to mature LIB’s technology and manufacturing scalability using existing Li-ion gigafactories. Additionally, SIBs can be adapted to other emerging technologies, including Li-ion batteries and silicon-based anodes, influencing projections for their broader use. However, despite the lower cost and abundance of sodium chemistries compared to lithium ones, limited manufacturing capacity discourages material suppliers from increasing production, which restricts the supply chain, raises costs, and diminishes Na battery manufacturing. Here, we aim to provide an overview of the progress of SIBs in gaining market share from LIBs. We first reviewed LIB and SIB histories, developments, and market share. Then, we analyzed the offered chemicals in battery components, their resources and supplies, material demand, and supply chain. The commercialization of each system was investigated in addition to the challenges related to energy density, environmental impact, sustainability, and safety. If all these concerns are addressed properly, LIBs and SIBs could potentially offer a more affordable, safer, and sustainable choice for the global energy storage outlook, particularly in short-range electric vehicles and stationary grid storage.

Data-driven methods are widely used to estimate SOH; however, existing methods often suffer from fixed or excessively high feature dimensions, impacting the model’s adjustability and applicability. This study first proposed a layered knee point strategy based on the charging voltage curve, which reduced the complexity of feature extraction. Then, a new hybrid framework called the adaptive gated sequence network (AGSN) model was proposed. This model integrated independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN) layers, active state tracking long short-term memory (AST-LSTM) layers, and adaptive gating mechanism (AGM) layers. By integrating a multi-layered structure and an adaptive gating mechanism, the SOH prediction performance was significantly improved. Finally, batteries under different operating conditions were tested using the NASA battery dataset. The results show that the AGSN model demonstrated higher accuracy and robustness in battery SOH estimation, with estimation errors consistently within 1%. Full article"
Revisiting Pulse-Based OCV Incremental Capacity Analysis for Diagnostics of Li-Ion Batteries,"Julia Wind, Preben J. S. Vie",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10080277,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/277/pdf?version=1722662345,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/277,4,"This paper presents the concept of applying incremental capacity analysis (ICA) on the OCV curve in the SoC space. The OCV curve can be obtained from any sequence of discharge or charge current or power pulse with a necessary rest period to allow the cell to reach a pseudo-OCV after each pulse. With a high resolution (>100 pulses) in the full SoC window, an OCV-vs.-SoC curve can be obtained with sufficient accuracy to perform an ICA on the obtained OCV curve. ICA as a diagnostic technique has commonly been applied on Li-ion cells with constant charge and discharge at slow currents. However, a slow controlled constant current charge or discharge is normally not feasible and cannot be easily applied to a battery in an application. Here, we revisit pulse-based ICA to supplement the conventional constant-current-based technique. Based on actual ageing data, we show that ICA performed on a selection of high-resolution OCV curves is comparable or better than conventional ICA with constant current. The main advantage of OCV-ICA is that it can be applied to most cells and systems without a significant interruption of normal cell operation. OCV-ICA can provide valuable insights into ageing mechanisms as well as, e.g., detailed information on changes in internal resistance. Full article"
Investigating the Role of Flow Plate Surface Roughness in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells with the Use of Multiphysics Simulations,"Odysseas Gkionis-Konstantatos, Luciana Tavares, Thomas Ebel",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10080276,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/276/pdf?version=1722353178,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/276,2,"This study investigates the influence of surface roughness on the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) through computational simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. Two distinct gas flow channel (GFC) models of serpentine and parallel GFC structures were analysed, featuring various surface roughness levels to examine their impact on gas pressure and velocity dynamics. Rough surfaces are modeled using trigonometric functions to replicate machining-induced variations. Finite element simulations were conducted, assessing the time-dependent relationship between gas pressure and velocity while considering different electrode phase potentials as a function of surface roughness. Rough surfaces generally enhance mass transport, water management, and current distribution compared to smooth surfaces. The results indicated that a surface roughness of approximately 1 µm optimizes PEMFC performance by balancing pressure and velocity, enhancing electrochemical reactions, and reducing excessive pressure drops within the cell. Notably, the 0.7 V operating voltage was found to be the most efficient, achieving rapid stabilization of pressure and velocity levels swiftly. The findings underscore the importance of precise control over GFC roughness to enhance PEMFC performance gains in commercial applications, especially when multiple cells are stacked to achieve high power outputs.

Existing degradation studies usually focus on commercial cells. The initial electrolyte composition and formation protocol for these cells is often unknown. This study investigates the role of electrolyte additives, specifically, vinylene carbonate (VC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), in the aging process of lithium-ion batteries. The results showed that self-discharge plays a significant role in determining the severity of aging for cells without additives. Interestingly, the aging was less severe for the cells without additives as they deviated more from their original storage state of charge. It was also observed that the addition of VC and FEC had an effect on the formation and stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the surface of the carbonaceous anode. By gaining a better understanding of the aging processes and the effects of different electrolyte additives, we can improve the safety and durability of lithium-ion batteries, which is critical for their widespread adoption in various applications.

In this work, a stack of five similar cells was cycled at a higher C-rate and water-cooled to create a larger temperature gradient for comparison with the air-cooled stack. It was hypothesized that the larger temperature gradient in the water-cooled stack would exacerbate the degradation of the middle cell. However, the results showed that the middle cell degraded slightly slower than the side cells in the water-cooled stack. This trend is opposite to that in the air-cooled stack. This difference could be attributed to the combined effects of a smaller temperature rise and larger temperature gradient in the water-cooled stack than in the air-cooled stack. Post-mortem analysis of cycled cells and a fresh cell showed that the degradation mainly came from the anode. Increased lithium plating and decreased porosity in the side cells are possible mechanisms for the faster degradation compared with the middle cell. It was also found that all the cells in the water-cooled stack experienced a phenomenon of capacity drop and recovery after a low C-rate reference performance test and extended rest. This phenomenon can be attributed to lithium diffusion between the anode active area and the anode overhang area. Full article"

However, the structural stability of nickel-based cathode materials becomes compromised when accompanied by the increasing of voltage, leading to poor cycling performance and, thus, hindering their widespread industrial application. In this work, we investigated the optimal charge cut-off voltage for the nickel-based cathode material LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.4 O 2 (NM64). Within the voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5 V, the electrode energy density reached 784.08 Wh/kg, with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 84.49%. The reversible specific capacity at 0.1 C reached 197.84 mAh/g, and it still maintained a high reversible specific capacity of nearly 150 mAh/g, with a capacity retention rate of 86% after 150 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, NM64 exhibited an intact morphological structure without noticeable cracking after 150 cycles, indicating excellent structural stability.

As revealed by physicochemical characterization, F-doped carbon coating and graphene form a ‘point-to-surface’ conductive network, facilitating rapid electron transport and mitigating electrochemical polarization. Furthermore, the uniform thickness of the F-doped carbon coating alters the growth of nanoparticles and prevents direct contact between the material and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing structural stability. The strongly electronegative F − can inhibit the structural changes in LMFP during charge/discharge, thus reducing the Jahn–Teller effect of Mn 3+ . The distinctive architecture of the LMFP/C-F/G cathode material exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, exhibiting an initial discharge capacity of 163.1 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C and a constant Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 100 cycles.

This paper conducts a lateral heating experiment on 280 Ah lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFPs) and proposes a method for testing battery internal pressure using an embedded pressure sensor. This paper analyzes the battery characteristic temperature, internal pressure, chamber pressure, and gas components under different chamber pressures. The experiment is carried out in a N 2 atmosphere using a 1000 L insulated chamber. At 40 kPa, the battery experiences two instances of venting, with a corresponding peak in temperature on the battery’s side of 136.3 °C and 302.8 °C, and gas generation rates of 0.14 mol/s and 0.09 mol/s, respectively. The research results indicate that changes in chamber pressure significantly affect the center temperature of the battery side ( T s ), the center temperature of the chamber ( T c ), the opening time of the safety valve ( t open ), the triggering time of TR ( t TR ), the time difference (Δ t ), venting velocity, gas composition, and flammable limits. However, the internal pressure and gas content of the battery are apparently unaffected. Considering the TR characteristics mentioned above, a safety assessment method is proposed to evaluate the TR behavior and gas hazard of the battery. The results indicate that the risk at 40 kPa is much higher than the other three chamber pressures.

The issue of arc faults resulting from electrical failures is especially critical, as it can lead to catastrophic battery disasters. Therefore, this paper first established an arc testing platform and conducted experiments on top cover and body of prismatic lithium-ion batteries to analyze the thermoelectric characteristics between arc and battery. Under experimental conditions of 300 V and 15 A, it was found that arcs can induce thermal runaway in batteries. Subsequently, based on the experimental conditions, a mathematical model was established to induce thermal runaway in batteries through an equivalent method of arc heat source. By comparing the temperature curves of model and experiment, the RMSE of temperature at the center point of large surface was 5.09 °C (with a maximum temperature of 212 °C), indicating the accuracy of the model. This paper’s research on arc faults in battery systems revealed the evolution pattern and realized that arcs can trigger thermal runaway in batteries. The model for arc-triggered thermal runaway in batteries is highly accurate, capable of reducing the number of experiments, accelerating experimental progress, and is of significant importance for guiding the design of arc experiments about batteries.

This review thoroughly examines various binders, focusing on their solubilities in water and organic solvents. Understanding binder mechanisms is crucial for developing binders that maintain strong adhesion to electrodes, even during volume fluctuations caused by lithiation and delithiation. Therefore, we investigated the different mechanisms associated with binders. This review also discusses failure mechanisms and innovative design strategies to improve the performance of binders, such as composite, conductive, and self-healing binders.

"Advanced Thermal Management of Cylindrical Lithium-Ion Battery Packs in Electric Vehicles: A Comparative CFD Study of Vertical, Horizontal, and Optimised Liquid Cooling Designs","Michael Murphy, Mohammad Akrami",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10080264,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/264/pdf?version=1722221308,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/8/264,3,"Battery packs found in electric vehicles (EVs) require thermal management systems to maintain safe operating temperatures in order to improve device performance and alleviate irregular temperatures that can cause irreversible damage to the cells. Cylindrical lithium-ion batteries are widely used in the electric vehicle industry due to their high energy density and extended life cycle. This report investigates the thermal performance of three liquid cooling designs for a six-cell battery pack using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The first two designs, vertical flow design (VFD) and horizontal flow design (HFD), are influenced by existing linear and wavy channel structures. They went through multiple geometry optimisations, where parameters such as inlet velocity, the number of channels, and channel diameter were tested before being combined into the third and final optimal design (OD). All designs successfully maintained the maximum temperature of the cells below 306.5 K at an inlet velocity of 0.5 ms −1 , meeting the predefined performance thresholds derived from the literature. The HFD design was the only one that failed to meet the temperature uniformity goal of 5 K. The optimal design achieved a maximum temperature of 301.311 K, which was 2.223 K lower than the VFD, and 4.707 K lower than the HFD. Furthermore, it produced a cell temperature difference of 1.144 K, outperforming the next-best design by 1.647 K, thus demonstrating superior temperature regulation. The OD design can manage temperatures by using lower inlet velocities and reducing power consumption. However, the increased cooling efficiency comes at the cost of an increase in weight for the system. This prompts the decision on whether to accommodate the added weight for improved safety or to allocate it to the addition of more batteries to enhance the vehicle’s power output. Full article"

Frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 0.1 Hz were injected into lithium-ion batteries, and the variation of the internal impedance of the batteries was obtained based on the reflected wave to determine the ESS state of charge (SoC) and temperature. The changes in the basic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characteristics of the ESSs were observed. Specifically, the voltage, temperature, and SoC of an ESS that could be employed as a renewable ESS were analyzed. The impedance characteristics of the ESS were investigated via experimentation and simulation. The ESS comprised an electrically equivalent circuit of a series inductor ( L S ), series resistor ( R S ), parallel resistor ( R P ), and parallel capacitor ( C P ), as well as a MATLAB program based on its transfer function to generate energy.

A common strategy to mitigate electrode mechanical degradation is to suppress the volume variation induced by Li/Na intercalation/deintercalation, thereby designing strain-less electrodes. In this study, we investigate the electrochemically-induced volume variation in layered and spinel compounds used in Li-ion and Na-ion battery electrode materials through density functional theory computations. Specifically, we propose to decompose the volume variation into electronic, ionic, and structural contributions. Based on this analysis, we suggest methods to separately influence each contribution through strategies such as chemical substitution, doping, and polymorphism. Altogether, we conclude that volume variations can be controlled by designing either mechanically hard or compact electrode materials. Full article"

Lithium–oxygen batteries have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their exceptionally high theoretical energy density. However, challenges such as poor electrolyte stability, short cycle life, low discharge capacity, and high overpotential arise from the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging.

However, the sluggish ion transport caused by longer and more tortuous pathways hinders high energy delivery when extracting high power. This study presents the implementation of neural networks to optimize the gradient active material distribution profile throughout the thickness of electrodes to enhance energy density. The profiles were randomly generated, while maintaining a constant average active material in each electrode. An electrochemical–thermal model was used to investigate the impact of different profiles. A neural network model was then developed to establish the connection between the profiles and the resulting energy density for various electrode thicknesses and C-rates, utilizing a limited amount of simulation data. The neural network model could replicate the performance of the electrochemical–thermal model, but with significantly reduced computational time. This enabled the possibility of efficiently exploring a vast number of candidate profiles to identify the most optimal one for each of the positive and negative electrodes. The results showed that the gradient profiles were mostly influenced by the average active material, rather than the thickness of the electrode. Finally, at high currents, the optimal gradient profiles increased the energy density by over four times compared to uniform electrodes. Full article"

In addition, solar energy is harnessed in various electronic devices to charge the batteries and power electronic equipment. Due to its ubiquitous nature, the corresponding market for solar-charged small-scale batteries is growing fast. The most important part to make the technology feasible is a portable battery charger and the associated controllers to automate battery charging. The charger should consider the case of charging to be convenient for the user and minimize battery degradation. However, the issue of slow charging and premature battery life loss plagues current industry standards or innovative battery technologies. In this paper, a new pulse charging technique is proposed that obviates battery deterioration and minimizes the overall charging loss. The solar-powered battery charger is prototyped and executed as a practical, versatile, and compact photovoltaic charge controller at cut rates. With the aid of sensor fusion, the charge controller is disconnected and reconnects the battery during battery overcharging and deep discharging conditions using sensors with relays. The laboratory model is tested using a less expensive PV panel, battery, and digital signal processor (DSP) controller. The charging behavior of the solar-powered PWM charge controller is studied compared with that of the constant voltage–constant current (CV–CC) method. The proposed method is pertinent for minimizing energy issues in impoverished places at a reasonable price. Full article"

Herein, we utilize pristine and commercially available SnO 2 nanopowders and enhance their cycling performance by simply narrowing the potential range and optimizing electrolytes. Specifically, a narrower potential range (0–1 V) mitigates the capacity fading associated with the conversion reaction, whereas an ether-based electrolyte further suppresses the volume expansion related to the alloy reaction. Consequently, this SnO 2 anode delivers a promising battery performance, with a high capacity of ~650 mAhg −1 and stable cycling for 100 cycles.

This work investigates the effects of C-rates and temperature on pressure behavior in commercial lithium cobalt oxide (LCO)/graphite pouch cells. The battery is volumetrically constrained, and the mechanical pressure response is measured using a force gauge as the battery is cycled. The effect of the C-rate (1C, 2C, and 3C) and ambient temperature (10 °C, 25 °C, and 40 °C) on the increase in battery pressure is investigated. By analyzing the change in the minimum, maximum, and pressure difference per cycle, we identify and discuss the effects of different factors (i.e., SEI layer damage, electrolyte decomposition, lithium plating) on the pressure behavior. Operating at high C-rates or low temperatures rapidly increases the residual pressure as the battery is cycled. The results suggest that lithium plating is predominantly responsible for battery expansion and pressure increase during the cycle aging of Li-ion cells rather than electrolyte decomposition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements can support our conclusions. Postmortem analysis of the aged cells was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to confirm the occurrence of lithium plating and film growth on the anodes of the aged cells. This study demonstrates that pressure measurements can provide insights into the aging mechanisms of Li-ion batteries and can be used as a reliable predictor of battery degradation. Full article"

ESSs are typically composed of series-parallel connections with numerous Li-ion batteries, and when the temperature of a deteriorated cell increases due to thermal, electrical, and mechanical stress, thermal runaway can occur due to additional heat generated by an internal chemical reaction. Here, an internal chemical reaction in a Li-ion battery results in the different characteristics on the decomposition reaction and heat release depending on the operation conditions in the ESS, such as the rising temperature rate, convective heat transfer coefficient, and C-rate of charging and discharging. Therefore, this paper presents mathematical equations and modeling of thermal runaway, composed of the heating device section, heat release section by chemical reaction, chemical reaction section at the SEI layer, chemical reaction section between the negative and positive electrodes and solvents, and chemical reaction section at the electrolyte by itself, based on MATLAB/SIMULINK (2022), which were validated by a thermal runaway test device. From the simulation and test results based on the proposed simulation modeling and test device according to the operation conditions in ESSs, it was found that the proposed modeling is an effective and reliable tool to evaluate the processing characteristics of thermal runaway because the occurrence time intervals and maximum temperatures had almost the same values in both the test device and simulation modeling. Accordingly, it was confirmed that the rising temperature rate and the convective heat transfer coefficient were more critical in the thermal runaway than the C-rate of charging and discharging.

The upper-layer control strategy is the system-level control. Considering the energy storage margin of each energy storage system, fuzzy logic control (FLC) is used to make the initial power allocation between the battery energy storage system (BESS) and the multistack fuel cell system (MFCS). The lower-layer control strategy is the device-level control. Considering the individual differences and energy-storage margin differences of the single-stack fuel cell (FC) in an MFCS, FLC is used to make the initial power allocation of the FC. To improve the hydrogen-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the MFCS, a strategy for optimization by perturbation (OP) is used to adjust the power allocation of the FC. The output difference of the MFCS before and after the adjustment is compensated for by the BESS. The simulation and experiment results show that the mentioned coordinated control strategy can enable the HESS to achieve adaptive power allocation based on the energy storage margin and obtain an improvement in the hydrogen-to-electricity conversion efficiency of the MFCS.

The viability of battery swapping stations is contingent upon the operational requirements and range capabilities of the ETBSm. Low temperatures have the effect of reducing the range of the ETBSm, thereby creating difficulties for battery swapping. This article proposes the use of motor waste heat recovery (MWHR) to heat batteries, which would improve range. A number of subsystem models have been established, including the ETBSm, battery, motor, and thermal management system (TMS). The calibration of battery temperature and motor efficiency is achieved with a model error of less than 5%. Comparison of performance, such as temperature, energy consumption, and range, when using only positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heating and when using both PTC heating and motor waste heat. The results indicate a 15% increase in the rate of rise in battery temperature and a 10.64 kW·h reduction in energy consumption under Chinese heavy-duty vehicle commercial vehicle test cycle (CHTC) conditions. Then, the motor waste heat percentage, energy consumption, and range are analyzed at different ambient temperatures. At an ambient temperature of −20 °C, −10 °C, and 0 °C, the percentage of the motor waste heat is 32.1%, 35%, and 40.5%; when 75% of the state of charge (SOC) is consumed, the range is improved by 6.55%, 4.37%, and 4.49%. Additionally, the effect of the PTC heater on temperature characteristics and power consumption is investigated by changing the target temperature of the coolant at the battery inlet. In accordance with the stipulated conditions of an ambient temperature of −20 °C and a target coolant temperature of 40 °C at the battery inlet, the simulation results indicated a battery temperature rise rate of 0.85 °C/min, accompanied by a PTC power consumption of 15.6 kW·h. This study demonstrates that as the ambient temperature increases, the utilization of motor waste heat becomes more effective in reducing PTC heating power consumption. At the lowest ambient temperature tested, the greatest improvement in driving range is observed. It is important to note that while an increase in the target heating temperature of the PTC helps to raise the battery temperature more rapidly, this is accompanied by a higher energy consumption.

First, only partial voltage segments are utilized for incremental capacity analysis, which are then fed into a stacked bidirectional gated recursive unit (SBiGRU) network, and finally, transfer learning is utilized to address issues related to limited data availability and differing data distributions. The method is further enhanced through hyperparameter optimization to refine estimation accuracy. The proposed method is validated in two publicly available datasets. For the base model, the root mean square error is 0.0033. With the transfer learning method, which utilized only 1.6% of the target domain data, the root mean square error is 0.0039.

Nonetheless, there are the following two common problems with the health assessment models for lithium-ion batteries that are currently in use: inability to comprehend the assessment results and the uncertainty around the chemical reactions occurring inside the battery. A rule-based modeling strategy that can handle ambiguous data in health state evaluation is the belief rule base (BRB). In existing BRB studies, experts often provide parameters such as the initial belief degree, but the parameters may not match the current data. In addition, random global optimization methods may undermine the interpretability of expert knowledge. Therefore, this paper proposes a lithium-ion battery health assessment method based on the double optimization belief rule base with interpretability (DO-BRB-I). First, the belief degree is optimized according to the data distribution. Then, to increase accuracy, belief degrees and other parameters are further optimized using the projection covariance matrix adaptive evolution strategy (P-CMA-ES). At the same time, four interpretability constraint strategies are suggested based on the features of lithium-ion batteries to preserve interpretability throughout the optimization process. Finally, to confirm the efficacy of the suggested approach, a sample of the health status assessment of the B0006 lithium-ion battery is provided. Full article"

The PBC is designed as a current controller using the reference provided by the filter to regulate the system’s load current. Additionally, an external loop is employed to regulate the SC voltage to a desired value. In this external loop, a low-pass filter is included to decouple voltage and current control during instantaneous changes in load. A detailed, step-by-step description of both the PBC and the SC voltage control strategy is provided, illustrating how voltage regulation is effectively decoupled from current control to ensure optimal operation during load transients. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through simulations and Power Hardware-in-the-Loop testing under variable current loads. This comprehensive evaluation method enables testing of control strategies in scenarios closely resembling real-world applications. Full article"

The excellent physical integrity of an anode made of diamond on silicon and the long-life and high-capacity-retention cycling performance are thus achieved for lithium-ion batteries. A specific capacity of 1860 mAh/g(si) was retained after 200 cycles of discharge/charge at an areal current density of 0.2 mA/cm 2 .

However, their practical use is limited due to significant volume changes during charge/discharge cycles, which negatively impact electrochemical performance. This study proposes a practical method to increase silicon content in lithium-ion batteries with minimal changes to the manufacturing process by using dual-layer electrodes (DLEs). These DLEs are fabricated with two slurries containing silicon and graphite as active materials. Notably, the electrode with the silicon as the outermost layer on top of the graphite layer (Si-on-top) demonstrated a superior initial capacity of 935 mAh/g and retained 70% of its capacity (537 mAh/g) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. In contrast, a single-layered electrode (SLE) with a silicon–graphite mixture retained only 50.3% of its capacity (370 mAh/g) under the same conditions. These findings suggest that DLEs, particularly with the silicon layer located on top, effectively increase silicon content in the negative electrode while remaining compatible with existing manufacturing processes. This approach offers a realistic strategy for enhancing the performance of lithium-ion batteries without significant process modifications. Full article"

The IL 1-Methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide has been selected for this work, due to the good thermal and chemical stabilities and good electrochemical performance of the pyrrolidinium cation based ILs. Binary mixtures of this IL and lithium salt with the same anion, [TFSI], have been prepared with the aim of assessing them, as possible electrolytes for lithium batteries. These mixtures were thermally and electrochemically characterised through DSC and dielectric spectroscopy studies. The ionic conductivity decreases as the salt concentration increases, finding values ranging between 0.4 S/m and 0.1 S/m at room temperature. Additionally, a wide liquid range was found for the mixtures, which would reduce or even eliminate some of the most common problems of current electrolytes, such as their crystallisation at low temperatures and flammability. Finally, the toxicity of pure IL and the intermediate salt concentration was also evaluated in terms of the bioluminescence inhibition of the Alivibrio Fischeri bacteria, observing that, although the toxicity increases with the salt addition, both samples can be classified as practically harmless.

Epoxy resin board (ERB) offers a wide range of applications in LIBs due to its significant advantages such as high dielectric strength, electrical insulation, good mechanical strength, and stiffness. This study proposes an air-cooled battery module comprised of sixteen prismatic batteries incorporating an ERB layer between the batteries. To compare the performance of the ERB-based air-cooling system, two other air-cooling structures are also assessed in this study. Three-dimensional numerical models for the three cases are established in this paper, and the heat dissipation processes of the battery module under varying discharge rates (1C, 2C, and 5C) are simulated and analyzed to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the different cooling systems. Comparative simulations reveal that incorporating ERB into the battery assembly significantly reduces battery surface temperatures and promotes temperature uniformity across individual batteries and the entire pack at various discharge rates. Notably, under 5C discharge conditions, the ERB-based thermal management system achieves a maximum battery surface temperature increase of 16 °C and a maximum temperature difference of 8 °C between batteries. Additionally, this paper also analyzes the impact of battery arrangement on air-cooling system performance. Therefore, further optimization of the structural design or the integration of supplementary cooling media might be necessary for such demanding conditions. Full article"

In this paper, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), capable of retaining H 2 O through hydrogen bonding, was used in an attempt to better control the amount of H 2 O available for NaBH 4 self-hydrolysis. This strategy led to the ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10 −3 S cm −1 at 45 °C with a Na + transference number of 0.54. The amorphous nature of the PEO matrix in hydrolyzed NaBH 4 is also believed to provide a conduction path for fast Na + conduction. Full article"

Traditional methods for SOH estimation, such as Coulomb counting, often struggle with sensitivity to measurement noise and time-consuming tests. This study addresses this issue by combining incremental capacity (IC) analysis and a novel neural network, Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs). Fifteen features were extracted from IC curves and a 2RC equivalent circuit model was used to identify the internal resistance of batteries. Recursive least squares were used to identify the parameters of the equivalent circuit model. IC features and internal resistance were considered as input variables to establish the SOH estimation model. Three commonly used machine learning methods (BP, LSTM, TCN) and two hybrid algorithms (LSTM-KAN and TCN-KAN) were used to establish the SOH estimation model. The performance of the five models was compared and analyzed. The results demonstrated that the hybrid models integrated with the KAN performed better than the conventional models, and the LSTM-KAN model had higher estimation accuracy than that of the other models. The model achieved a mean absolute error of less than 0.412% in SOH prediction in the test and validation dataset. The proposed model does not require complete charge and discharge data, which provides a promising tool for the accurate monitoring and fast detection of battery SOH. Full article"

The influence on the electrical voltage response is derived and merged into a mathematical calculation framework describing all fundamental phenomena inside a battery. The parameters, whose sole influences on the electric behaviour cannot be separated at the cell level, are summarised to derive a model with purely electrical quantities. We significantly reduce the model order compared to a physicochemical model while ensuring a minimal approximation error. Utilising the findings from the model derivation, we develop a parameterisation procedure to separate the individual processes occurring in the battery and to support a hypothesis of the assignment to positive and negative electrodes based on several indicia. For this purpose, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and correlation analysis are used to calculate the distribution of the time constants. The final parameterised model has physics-based parameter variations, which ensures that the simulation over broad ranges of temperatures and states of charge results in a reasonable voltage response. The model’s physical basis enables extrapolation beyond the measured operation area, and the model verification shows less than a 10 mV root mean square error over a wide range of operations.

These electrical and mechanical factors may contribute to performance improvement, with carbon bands serving as a mechanical buffer for Si deformation and providing electrical conduction pathways.

The evaluation of an Fe-based MG as a novel negative electrode material for nickel/metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries was carried out through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge tests. A conventional LaNi 5 electrode was also evaluated for comparative purposes. The electrochemical results obtained by cyclic voltammetry showed the formation of three peaks, which are associated with the formation of Fe oxides/oxyhydroxides and hydroxides. Cycling charge/discharge tests revealed activation of the MG electrode. The highest discharge capacity value was 173.88 mAh/g, but a decay in its capacity was observed after 25 cycles, contrary to the LaNi 5 , which presents an increment of the discharge capacity for all the current density values evaluated, reached its value maximum at 183 mAh/g. Characterization analyses performed by X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy revealed the presence of corrosion products and porosity on the surface of the Fe-based MG electrodes. Overall, the Fe-based MG composition is potentially able to work as a negative electrode material, but degradation and little information about storage mechanisms means that it requires further investigation.

During the model transfer phase, the CNN and LSTM layers of the pre-trained model from the source domain are kept unchanged during retraining, while the attention and fully connected layers are fine-tuned for NASA batteries and self-tested NCM batteries. The final results indicate that this method achieves superior accuracy relative to other methods while addressing the issue of limited labeled data in the target domain through transfer learning, thereby enhancing the model’s transferability and generalization capabilities.

By combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, the influence of the depths of the distribution and convergence plenums on the airflow velocity through battery cells was analyzed to improve heat dissipation efficiency. Adjusting the width of the first and ninth cooling channels can change the air velocity of these two channels, thereby improving the temperature uniformity of the BTMS. Further discussion was conducted regarding the influences of inlet and outlet depths. When the inlet width and outlet width were 20 mm, the maximum temperature and maximum temperature difference of the Y-type BTMS were 39.84 °C and 0.066 °C at a discharge rate of 2.5 °C, respectively; these temperatures were 1.537 °C (3.68%) and 0.059 °C (47.2%) lower than those of the T-type model. Meanwhile, the energy consumption of the sample also decreased by 13.1%. The results indicate that the heat dissipation performance of the proposed Y-type BTMS was improved, achieving excellent temperature uniformity, and the energy consumption was also reduced.

Fire caused by LIB thermal runaway (TR) can be catastrophic within enclosed spaces where emission ventilation or occupant evacuation is challenging or impossible. The fine smoke particles (PM 2.5 ) produced during a fire can deposit in deep parts of the lung and trigger various adverse health effects. This study characterizes the chemical composition of PM 2.5 released from TR-driven combustion of cylindrical lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and pouch-style lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) LIB cells. Emissions from cell venting and flaming combustion were measured in real time and captured by filter assemblies for subsequent analyses of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), elements, and water-soluble ions. The most abundant PM 2.5 constituents were OC, EC, phosphate (PO 4 3− ), and fluoride (F − ), contributing 7–91%, 0.2–40%, 1–44%, and 0.7–3% to the PM 2.5 mass, respectively. While OC was more abundant during cell venting, EC and PO 4 3− were more abundant when flaming combustion occurred. These freshly emitted particles were acidic. Overall, particles from LFP tests had higher OM but lower EC compared to LCO tests, consistent with the higher thermal stability of LFP cells. Full article"

Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are commonly employed as convenient modes of transportation. Thanks to the advantages of long life and high energy density, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in e-bikes. In certain business models, e-bikes can utilize rental LIBs, which are centrally managed at charging stations. The low-temperature charging and discharging performance of the LIB system poses a significant challenge during usage. Among various heating methods, alternating current (AC) heating has garnered attention due to its high efficiency and has been applied to quickly warm up the LIB system. To address this issue, an AC heating model was established to determine the appropriate frequency and magnitude of the current, and a prototype AC heating system for the LIB modules used in e-bikes was designed. A full-bridge topology system model was established, and an experimental platform was constructed to test the effectiveness of the proposed AC heating topology and thermoelectric model under different AC heating frequencies and currents. The results show that the proposed AC heating system can heat an 18650 battery module within 20 min. Under an ambient temperature of −20 °C, using a 10 A, a 100 Hz excitation current achieves a heating rate of 1.3 °C per minute, with minimum power losses. The prototype also has a fast response time of only 70 ms. Finally, the strategies of LIB heating and insulation are proposed for the scenario of a battery swapping station. This research holds great significance in resolving the problem of low-temperature heating for e-bikes in cold regions. Full article"

With the projected sale of millions of electric vehicles globally by 2022 and over a million electric vehicles in Europe alone in the first quarter of 2023, the necessity of securing a sustainable supply of lithium-ion batteries has reached a critical point. As the demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage (ESS) systems increases, so too does the necessity to address the shortage of lithium batteries and implement effective recycling and recovery practices. A considerable number of electric vehicle batteries will reach the end of their useful life in the near future, resulting in a significant increase in the number of used batteries. It is of paramount importance to accurately identify the manufacturer and model of cylindrical batteries to ascertain their State of Health (SoH) and guarantee their efficient reuse. This study focuses on the automation of the identification of cylindrical cells through optical character recognition (OCR) and the analysis of the external color of the cell and the anode morphology based on computer vision techniques. This is a novel work in the current limited literature, which aims to bridge the gap between industrialized lithium-ion cell recovery processes and an automated SoH calculation. Accurate battery identification optimizes battery reuse, reduces manufacturing costs and mitigates environmental impact.

Investigation on Thermal Runaway Hazards of Cylindrical and Pouch Lithium-Ion Batteries under Low Pressure of Cruise Altitude for Civil Aircraft,"Qiang Sun, Hangxin Liu, Zhi Wang, Yawei Meng, Chun Xu, Yanxing Wen, Qiyao Wu",2024,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10090298,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/9/298/pdf?version=1729846069,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/10/9/298,5,"Thermal runaway characteristics and hazards of lithium-ion batteries under low ambient pressure in-flight conditions are studied in a dynamic pressure chamber. The influence of ambient pressures (95 kPa and 20 kPa) and packaging forms (cylindrical and pouch commercial batteries) were especially investigated. The results show that the values of heat release, temperature, and C O 2 concentration decrease with the reduction in pressure from 95 kPa to 20 kPa, while the total hydrocarbon and C O increase. Without violent fire, explosion, and huge jet flames, the thermal hazards of TR fire under 20 kPa are lower, but the amount of toxic/flammable gas emissions increases greatly. The amount of C O and hydrocarbons varies inversely with the thermal hazards of fire. Under low-pressure environments of cruise altitude, the thermal hazards of TR fire for pouch cells and the toxic/potentially explosive hazards of gas emissions of cylindrical cells need more attention. The performance of TR hazards for two packaging types of battery is also different. Pouch cells have higher thermal hazards of fire and lower combustible/toxic emitted gases than cylindrical cells. The thermal runaway intensity of individual cells decreases under lower ambient pressure, but the burning intensity increases dramatically when thermal runaway occurs in a battery pack. The open time of a safety valve (rupture of the bag) is shortened, but the trigger time for a thermal runaway varies for different formats of batteries under 20 kPa. Those results may be helpful for the safety warning and hazard protection design of Li batteries under low-pressure conditions. Full article"

This paper addresses managing a standalone DC microgrid that combines PV generation and a battery energy storage system (BESS). We propose a hybrid control strategy that combines a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers to improve the performance of the bidirectional converter that connects the BESS to the microgrid. The RNN processes the voltage error and derivative into a reference current, which a PI controller refines to determine the best duty cycle for the converter’s switches. This hybrid control scheme provides superior adaptability and performance in various load conditions, including pulsed power load (PPL) demands. Simulation results show that the proposed control method exceeds traditional PI-PI control algorithms, particularly in improving the transient stability of the DC bus voltage and optimizing BESS performance. We conducted extensive hardware experiments to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the developed control algorithm. The experimental results confirmed the superior performance of the hybrid RNN-PI control scheme, demonstrating its ability to maintain system stability and efficiency across a wide range of real-world scenarios. This experimental validation reflects the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in improving microgrid operations. Full article"

However, the low capacitance of commercial activated carbon (AC) cathode based on anion absorption/desorption limits LIC applications. Herein, commercial graphite is proposed as the cathode to construct an innovative AC (−)//graphite (+) system. The graphite cathode functions as anion hosting, allowing reversible intercalation/de-intercalation of anions into/from its interlayers. The as-designed AC (−)//graphite (+) full cell achieves stable cycling with 90.6% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g −1 and a prolonged lifespan with 87.5% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 with the upper cut-off voltage of 5.0 V, yielding a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.3%. Moreover, the full cell exhibits a high energy density (>200 Wh kg −1 ) and power density of 7.7 kW kg −1 (calculated based on active mass in both electrodes).

The analysis focuses on the geometry and components’ thicknesses and deriving CAD models for both cell formats. Design variations were observed, even within cells from the same manufacturer. For instance, one manufacturer’s 26650 cell was not a scaled-up version of their 18650 cell, and no equivalence was found between the designs of high-power and low-temperature cells from the same manufacturer. Thus, modifications are not purely chemistry based. The results also reveal deviations from the literature values for jelly roll component thicknesses, with anode current collectors averaging 61 µm and cathode current collectors averaging 60 µm. Coating thicknesses varied, with anode coatings averaging 32 µm and cathode coatings averaging 52 µm. These variations in current collector and coating thicknesses suggest that both high-power and low-temperature LFP cell designs differ from the typical literature values. Furthermore, a trade-off was observed between low-temperature operation with two-tab designs and high pulse capability with limited minimum operating temperatures. Additionally, smaller particle sizes in anode coatings were associated with lower impedance. Full article"

Two configurations were compared: A control case without obstacles (Case 1) and a modified design with obstacles to enhance mass transport and uniformity (Case 2). While Case 1 exhibited marginally higher discharge voltages (average difference of 0.18%) due to reduced hydraulic resistance and lower Ohmic losses, Case 2 demonstrated significant improvements in concentration uniformity, particularly at low state-of-charge (SOC) levels. The obstacle design mitigated local depletion of active species, thereby enhancing limiting current density and improving minimum concentration values across the studied SOC range. However, the introduction of obstacles increased flow resistance and pressure drops, indicating a trade-off between electrochemical performance and pumping energy requirements. Notably, Case 2 performed better at lower flow rates, showcasing its potential to optimize efficiency under varying operating conditions. At higher flow rates, the advantages of Case 2 diminished but remained evident, with better concentration uniformity, higher minimum concentration values, and a 1% average increase in limiting current density. Future research should focus on optimizing obstacle geometry and positioning to further enhance performance. Full article"

However, safety concerns, such as the flammability of organic liquid electrolytes, have limited their extensive application. In the present study, we utilize molecular dynamics and Density Functional Theory based simulations to investigate the Li interactions in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), composed of a 3D cross-linked polymer matrix combined with two different non-flammable electrolytes: 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6 ) in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and 1 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in trimethyl phosphate (TMP) solvents. The findings derived from radial distribution functions, coordination numbers, and interaction energy calculations indicate that Li⁺ exhibits an affinity with solvent molecules and counter-anions over the functional groups on the polymer matrix, highlighting the preeminent influence of electrolyte components in Li⁺ solvation and transport. Furthermore, the second electrolyte demonstrated enhanced binding energies, implying greater ionic stability and conductivity relative to the first system. These findings offer insights into the Li + transport mechanism at the molecular scale in the GPE by suggesting that lithium-ion transport does not occur by hopping between polymer functional groups but by diffusion into the solvent/counter anion system. The information provided in the work allows for the improvement of the design of electrolytes in LiMBs to augment both safety and efficiency. Full article"
A Study on the Differences in Optimized Inputs of Various Data-Driven Methods for Battery Capacity Prediction,"Kuo Xin, Fu Jia, Byoungik Choi, Geesoo Lee",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11010026,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/1/26/pdf?version=1736776763,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/1/26,,"As lithium-ion batteries become increasingly popular worldwide, accurately determining their capacity is crucial for various devices that rely on them. Numerous data-driven methods have been applied to evaluate battery-related parameters. In the application of these methods, input features play a critical role. Most researchers often use the same input features to compare the performance of various neural network models. However, because most models are regarded as black-box models, different methods may show different dependencies on specific features given the inherent differences in their internal structures. And the corresponding optimal inputs of different neural network models should be different. Therefore, comparing the differences in optimized input features for different neural networks is essential. This paper extracts 11 types of lithium battery-related health features, and experiments are conducted on two traditional machine learning networks and three advanced deep learning networks in three aspects of input differences. The experiment aims to systematically evaluate how changes in health feature types, dimensions, and data volume affect the performance of different methods and find the optimal input for each method. The results demonstrate that each network has its own optimal input in the aspects of health feature types, dimensions, and data volume. Moreover, under the premise of obtaining more accurate prediction accuracy, different networks have different requirements for input data. Therefore, in the process of using different types of neural networks for battery capacity prediction, it is very important to determine the type, dimension, and number of input health features according to the structure, category, and actual application requirements of the network. Different inputs will lead to larger differences in results. The optimization degree of mean absolute error (MAE) can be improved by 10–50%, and other indicators can also be optimized to varying degrees. Therefore, it is very important to optimize the network in a targeted manner. Full article"

The main reason for this is that the temperature profile of a battery cell changes during aging. By using Differential Thermal Voltammetry (DTV), new possibilities are opened up, especially since this diagnostic method is designed to work in operando by only requiring voltage and temperature readings. In this study, a batch of NMC-21700 cells were aged in calendar and cyclic manners. After a specified aging cycle was complete, a check-up measurement was performed. During this time, the cycler collected the electrical measuring values, while a negative temperature coefficient thermistor, which was located on the cell, was used to record the temperature fluctuations. The data were then evaluated by using the DTV analysis technique. By comparing the characteristic points of DTV, correlations between the changing curve characteristics and the capacity loss, and therefore the aging of the respective cell, were established. Based on these results, a simple model suitable for online State of Health (SoH) is derived and validated, showing an estimation accuracy of 1.1 1.1 %. Full article"

Therefore, comparative research on the thermal runaway behaviors of various batteries is essential. This study investigates the thermal runaway characteristics of sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP), and lithium-ion batteries with NCM523 and NCM622 cathodes. The experiments were conducted in a nitrogen-filled constant-volume sealed chamber. The results show that the critical surface temperatures at the time of thermal runaway are as follows: LFP (346 °C) > NIBs (292 °C) > NCM523 (290 °C) > NCM622 (281 °C), with LFP batteries exhibiting the highest thermal runaway critical temperature. NIBs have the lowest thermal runaway triggering energy (158 kJ), while LFP has the highest (592.8 kJ). During the thermal runaway of all four battery types, the primary gases produced include carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, propylene, and ethane. For NCM622 and NCM523, carbon monoxide is the dominant combustible gas, with volume fractions of 35% and 29%, respectively. In contrast, hydrogen is the main flammable gas for LFP and NIBs, with volume fractions of 44% and 30%, respectively. Among these, NIBs have the lowest lower flammability limit (LFL), indicating the highest explosion risk.

The findings of the investigation indicate that lithium iron phosphate batteries exhibit pronounced superiority in terms of environmental sustainability, while ternary lithium batteries are more advantageous in terms of performance. The mitigation of environmental pollution associated with battery production can be significantly achieved by the holistic integration of clean energy sources and the systematic optimization of manufacturing processes. Specific interventions encompass enhancing the energy efficiency of the production process, incorporating renewable energy sources for power generation, and minimizing the utilization of hazardous materials.

However, due to the separation of the discharging and charging processes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) at swapping stations, and the circulation of batteries across different vehicles and stations, the operating data become fragmented, making it difficult to accurately identify the battery state-of-health (SOH). This study proposes a BiLSTM-Transformer framework that extracts the Constant Voltage Time (CVT) feature using only charging data, enabling the precise estimation of battery capacity degradation. Validation experiments conducted on battery samples under different operating temperatures showed that the model achieved a normalized RMSE of less than 1.6%. In ideal conditions, the normalized RMSE of the estimation reached as low as 0.11%. This model enables SOH estimation without relying on discharge data, contributing to the efficient and safe operation of battery swapping stations. Full article"

Current battery thermal management systems and battery modeling, relying on point measurement (thermocouples/thermistors), face challenges in providing comprehensive characterization for larger batteries and extensive monitoring across the pack. Here, we proposed a novel Rayleigh-scattering-based distributed optical fiber sensor to deliver thermal images of a large prismatic cell. Using an optical fiber of 1 mm diameter wrapped around the cell, the optical sensor delivered over 400 unique measurement locations at 3 mm spatial resolution. During a 1.0 C charge, the optical-measured maximum temperature difference was 8.2 °C, while point-like thermocouples, located at the cell front surface and rear surface center, only had a 0.8 °C maximum temperature difference. Moreover, the all-surface-covered optical sensor identified hotspot generation around the vicinity of the tabs, highlighting the essential role of tabs. The maximum temperature on the negative current tab reached 113.9 °C during a 1.5 C discharge, while the hottest spot on the cell surface was only 52.1 °C. This was further validated by the operando thermal image in both the time domain and the spatial domain, facilitating a detailed analysis of the thermal-behavior-like heat generation on the current tabs, transmission through the surface, and dissipation to the cell bottom.

The model’s feasibility was validated by comparing the simulated polarization data with the experimental results. Utilizing this model, the work reported here compared the flow characteristics and electrochemical properties of electrolytes with different redox couples within the porous electrodes of the batteries. Despite variations in the active materials, the distribution of the electrolyte flow rate showed uniformity due to consistent electrode and flow channel designs, indicating that the structural design of electrodes and channels has a more significant impact on electrolyte flow than the physicochemical properties of the electrolytes themselves. This study also highlighted that TEMPO and Quinoxaline DES electrolytes exhibited less flow resistance and more uniform concentration distributions, which helped reduce overpotentials and enhance battery energy efficiency. Furthermore, this research identified that the highest average overpotentials occurred near the membrane for all the redox couples, demonstrating that electrochemical reactions in DES electrolyte flow batteries primarily occur in the region close to the membrane. This finding underscores the importance of optimizing active redox ions transport in electrolytes to enhance electrochemical reactions in the proximal membrane region, which is crucial for improving flow battery performance.

To address these, we propose a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics and emphasize the need for larger and more diverse datasets. The review introduces an innovative clustering approach that provides a nuanced understanding of research trends and methodological gaps. In addition, we discuss the ethical implications of DL in RUL estimation, addressing concerns about privacy and algorithmic bias.

Alginates are polysaccharides extracted from algae, which form hydrogel materials upon interaction with divalent and trivalent cations. They are renewable, non-toxic, biocompatible materials that are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Mg 2+ is weakly bound to an alginate polymer, which results in a hydrogel-like material that contains mobile magnesium ions. We propose that this is the ideal situation for an electrolyte that behaves in a similar way as a ‘water-in-salt’ system. Magnesium alginate was successfully synthesized and characterized by FTIR, XRD, and PDF. Ionic conductivity was measured with EIS measurements; a 2 wt% magnesium electrolyte shows a conductivity of 1.8 mS/cm. During conductivity experiments, we noticed the formation of a black layer on magnesium electrodes, which can improve the ionic conductivity between the electrodes. We carefully characterized this layer with XPS and saw that it mainly consists of alginate derivatives. Full article"

The importance of this problem stems from the attractive specific energy levels achievable by Li-S batteries, which can be particularly appealing for applications such as aviation electrification. Previous research presents different Li-S battery models, including “zero-dimensional” models that neglect diffusion while using the laws of electrochemistry to represent reduction–oxidation (redox) rates. Zero-dimensional models typically succeed in capturing key features of Li-S battery discharge, including the high plateau, low plateau, and dip point visible in the discharge curves of certain Li-S battery chemistries. However, these models’ use of one state variable to represent the mass of each active species tends to furnish high-order models, with many state variables. This increases the computational complexity of model-based estimation and optimal control. The main contribution of this paper is to develop low-order state-space model of Li-S battery discharge. Specifically, the paper starts with a seventh-order zero-dimensional model of Li-S discharge dynamics, analyzes its discharge behavior, constructs phenomenological second- and third-order models capable of replicating this behavior, and parameterizes these models. The proposed models succeed in capturing battery discharge behavior accurately over a wide range of discharge rates. To the best of our knowledge, these are two of the simplest published models capable of doing so. Full article"

Accurate and prompt evaluations are essential for safety, battery life extension, and performance optimization. While traditional techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are commonly used to monitor battery degradation, acoustic emission (AE) analysis is emerging as a promising complementary method. AE’s sensitivity to mechanical changes within the battery structure offers significant advantages, including speed and non-destructive assessment, enabling evaluations without disassembly. This capability is particularly beneficial for diagnosing second-life batteries and streamlining decision-making regarding the management of used batteries. Moreover, AE enhances diagnostics by facilitating early detection of potential issues, optimizing maintenance, and improving the reliability and longevity of battery systems. Importantly, AE is a non-destructive technique and belongs to the passive method category, as it does not introduce any external energy into the system but instead detects naturally occurring acoustic signals during the battery’s operation. Integrating AE with other analytical techniques can create a comprehensive tool for continuous battery condition monitoring and predictive maintenance, which is crucial in applications where battery reliability is vital, such as in EVs and energy storage systems. This review not only examines the potential of AE techniques in battery health monitoring but also underscores the need for further research and adoption of these techniques, encouraging the academic community and industry professionals to explore and implement these methods.

This paper establishes a mathematical expression for a temperature–SOC-based impedance model at specific frequencies, i.e., 1 Hz, 20 Hz, and 3100 Hz. When comparing the models at these three frequencies, it was found that the model fitting accuracy is highest at 20 Hz, making it applicable across a wide range of temperatures and SOCs. Consequently, the accuracy of the impedance model can be enhanced at a specific frequency, simplifying the impedance model and facilitating the development of advanced battery state estimation methods.

This approach creates a three-dimensional porous composite cathode structure that facilitates electrolyte infiltration and forms a continuous conductive network for efficient electron transport. The in situ formed Na 6 CoS 4 /Co electrocatalysts, tightly integrated with Na 2 S, exhibit strong catalytic activity and robust physicochemical stabilization, thereby accelerating redox kinetics and mitigating the polysulfide shuttle effect. As a result, the Na 2 S–Na 6 CoS 4 /Co@C cathode achieves superior capacity retention, demonstrating a discharge capacity of 346 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles.

Nanoporous Carbon Coatings Direct Li Electrodeposition Morphology and Performance in Li Metal Anode Batteries,"Katharine L. Harrison, Subrahmanyam Goriparti, Daniel M. Long, Rachel I.

However, Li generally electrodeposits in poorly controlled morphology, leading to safety and performance problems. One factor that controls Li anode performance and electrodeposition morphology is the nature of the electrolyte–current collector interface. Herein, we modify the Cu current collector interface by depositing precisely controlled nanoporous carbon (NPC) coatings using pulsed laser deposition to develop an understanding of how NPC coating density and thickness impact Li electrodeposition. We find that NPC density and thickness guide Li morphological evolution differently and dictate whether Li deposits at the NPC-Cu or NPC-electrolyte interface. NPC coatings generally lower overpotential for Li electrodeposition, though thicker NPC coatings limit kinetics when cycling at a high rate. Lower-density NPC enables the highest Coulombic efficiency (CE) during calendar aging tests, and higher-density NPC enables the highest CE during cycling tests. Full article"

The maximum charging capacity of the cell is exerted within different SOCs and temperature ranges. Taking a power lithium-ion battery (LIB) with a capacity of 120 Ah as the research object, a rapid charging model of the battery module was established. The battery module was cooled by means of a liquid cooling system. The combination of the fast charging strategy and the cooling strategy was employed to comprehensively analyze the restrictions of the fast charging rate imposed by the battery SOC and temperature. The results indicate that when the coolant flow rate was 12 L/min and the inlet coolant temperature was 22 °C, the liquid cooling system possessed the optimal heat exchange capacity and the lowest energy consumption. The maximum temperature ( Tmax ) of the battery during the charging process was 50.04 °C, and the charging time was 2634 s. To lower the Tmax of the battery during the charging process, a charging rate limit was imposed on the temperature range above 48 °C based on the original fast charging strategy.

Increasing efforts are focused on improving their energy density and safety by replacing current materials with more efficient and safer alternatives. In this context, binary composites of organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and lithium salts show promise due to their impressive mechanical properties and ionic conductivity. Taking advantage of this, the present paper substitutes the commercial non-electrochemically active binder with an OIPC component, N -ethyl- N -methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ([C 2 mpyr][FSI]), in combination with LiFSI. Slurry-formulation experiments revealed that varying the new binder’s composition allows the production of diverse LiFePO 4 (LFP) cathodes via the conventional fabrication process. Large amounts of OIPC−lithium salt mixtures in the composition yielded thick electrodes with expected nominal areal capacities of up to 3.74 mAh/cm 2 , where the balanced composition with a reduced Li + concentration can demonstrate >1.5 mAh/cm 2 at 0.1C. Lowering the amount of these ion-conductive binders enabled LFP cathodes to perform effectively under fast cycling conditions at a C-rate as high as 2C. Preliminary battery tests with a limited Li + source demonstrated the feasibility of full-cell operation without using the lithium-metal anode. This work paves the way for developing advanced rechargeable batteries using OIPC-based ion-conductive binders for a wide range of applications. Full article"

Obtaining parameters is often conducted by optimization using evolutionary algorithms. Obtaining the initial state of charge is often conducted by measurements, which can be burdensome in practice. Incorrect initial conditions can introduce bias, leading to long-term drift and inaccurate state of charge readings. To address this, we propose two simple and efficient equivalent model frameworks that are optimized by a genetic algorithm and are able to determine the initial conditions autonomously. The first framework applies the feedback loop mechanism that gradually with time corrects the externally given initial condition that is originally a biased arbitrary value within a certain domain. The second framework applies the genetic algorithm to search for an unbiased estimate of the initial condition. Long-term experiments have demonstrated that these frameworks do not deviate from controlled benchmarks with known initial conditions. Additionally, our experiments have shown that all implemented models significantly outperformed the well-known ampere-hour coulomb counter integration method, which is prone to drift over time and the extended Kalman filter, that acted with bias.

The fin-embedded phase-change material energy storage tube (PCM-EST) offers significant potential due to its high thermal energy density and passive operation, but conventional designs face a critical trade-off: enhancing heat transfer typically increases mass, conflicting with EV lightweight requirements. To resolve this conflict, this study proposes a multi-objective surrogate optimization framework integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Kriging modeling. Fin geometric parameters—number, height, and tube length—were rigorously analyzed via ANSYS (2020 R1) Fluent simulations to quantify their coupled effects on PCM melting/solidification dynamics and structural mass. The results reveal that fin configurations dominate both thermal behavior and weight. An enhanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm was then deployed to simultaneously maximize heat transfer and minimize mass, generating a Pareto-optimal solution. The optimized design achieves 8.7% enhancement in heat exchange capability and 0.732 kg mass reduction—outperforming conventional single-parameter designs by 37% in weight savings.

These behaviors are primarily driven by variations in thermal properties and the amount of heat released during thermal decomposition. However, given the inherent variability in thermal property measurements, the specific values adopted can lead to substantial differences in predicted temperature behavior. In this study, we developed a 1-dimensional TP model for an array of three prismatic lithium-ion battery cells, in consideration of the uncertainty of key thermal parameters including specific heat, thermal conductivity, activation energy, and the latent heat of the thermal decomposition reaction. The validity of the model and the identification of calibration parameters are ensured through comparison with experimentally measured temperatures. We evaluated the influence of these parameter variations on the temperature and thermal runaway behavior of each cell. Our findings indicate that the variation in thermal runaway timing increases with distance from the trigger cell, and the probability of thermal runaway in the end cell was significantly higher than in the center cell. A sensitivity analysis using a surrogate model revealed that cell temperature is more sensitive to variations in thermal conductivity and latent heat than to variations in specific heat and activation energy.

The analysis integrates Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) to provide a holistic evaluation. The LCA covers the full cradle-to-grave stages, while LCOS accounts for capital and operational expenditures, efficiency, and cycling frequency. The results indicate that lithium-ion batteries achieve the lowest LCOS (120–180 EUR/MWh) and high round-trip efficiency (90–95%), making them optimal for short- and medium-duration storage.

To better understand the observed thermal behavior, complementary XRD and XPS analyses were performed. Generally, in all electrodes, the thermal decomposition of the electrode material is initiated by the exothermic decomposition of the SEI followed by a binder decomposition reaction around 265 °C. Interestingly, with increased states of delithiation from 400 mAh/g, endothermic peaks in the heat-flow signal of the DSC measurements are observed, which can be correlated with the structural and compositional changes in the electrode material as determined by XRD and XPS, respectively. These analyses confirmed the progressive formation of metallic tin on advanced delithiation. Additionally, the total heat generation from the electrodes decreased with increased delithiation.

Online Parameter Identification of a Fractional-Order Chaotic System for Lithium-Ion Battery RC Equivalent Circuit Using a State Observer,"Yanzeng Gao, Donghui Xu, Haiou Wen, Liqin Xu",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11100377,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/377/pdf?version=1760668229,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/377,,"Due to the highly nonlinear, dynamic, and slowly time-varying nature of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) during operation, achieving accurate and real-time parameters online identification in first-order RC equivalent circuit models (ECMs) remains a significant challenge, including low accuracy and poor real-time performance. This paper establishes a fractional-order chaotic system for first-order RC-ECM based on a charge-controlled memristor. The system exhibits chaotic behavior when parameters are tuned. Then, based on the principle of the state observer, an identification observer is designed for each unknown parameter of the first-order RC-ECM, achieving online identification of these unknown parameters of the first-order RC-ECM of LIB. The proposed method addresses key limitations of traditional parameter identification techniques, which often rely on large sample datasets and are sensitive to variations in ambient temperature, road conditions, load states, and battery chemistry. Experimental validation was conducted under the HPPC, DST, and UDDS conditions. Using the actual terminal voltage of a single cell as a reference, the identified first-order RC-ECM parameters enabled accurate prediction of the online terminal voltage. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed state observer achieves significantly higher accuracy than the forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) algorithm and Kalman filter (KF) algorithm, while offering superior real-time performance, robustness, and faster convergence.

Existing approaches are generally categorized into model-based methods, data-driven methods, and hybrid methods. A systematic comparison of these three methodological paradigms is presented, with hybrid methods further divided into filter-based hybrids and data-driven hybrids, followed by a comparative analysis of remaining useful life prediction accuracy. The literature analysis indicates that data-driven hybrid methods, by integrating the strengths of physical mechanism modeling and machine learning algorithms, exhibit superior robustness under complex operating conditions. Among them, the hybrid framework combining long short-term memory networks with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model optimized by the Binary Firefly Algorithm demonstrates the highest stability and accuracy in the reviewed studies, achieving a root mean squared error below 2% and a mean absolute percentage error below 1%. Future research may further enhance the generalization capability of this framework, reduce computational cost, and improve model interpretability. Full article"
Rapid Prediction of Maximum Remaining Capacity in Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on Charging Segment Features and GA_DBO_BPNN,"Yifei Cao, Rui Wang, Qizhi Li, Peng Zhou, Aqing Li, Penghao Cui, Quanhong Tao, Zhendong Shao",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11100375,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/375/pdf?version=1760369308,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/375,,"Rapid and accurate prediction of the maximum remaining life of lithium-ion batteries is a critical technical challenge for enhancing battery management system reliability and enabling the efficient secondary utilization of retired batteries. Traditional approaches that rely on full charge–discharge cycles or complex electrochemical models often suffer from long detection time and limited adaptability, making them unsuitable for fast testing scenarios. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel capacity prediction method that integrates charging segment feature extraction with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) co-optimized using the genetic algorithm (GA) and dung beetle optimizer (DBO). Leveraging the public CALCE datasets, key degradation-related features were extracted from partial charging segments to serve as inputs to the prediction framework. The hybrid GA_DBO algorithm is employed to jointly optimize the BPNN’s weights, learning rate, and activation thresholds. A comparative analysis is conducted across various charging durations (900 s, 1800 s, and 2700 s) to evaluate performance under different input lengths. Results reveal that the model using 1800 s charging segment features achieves the best overall accuracy, with a test set mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0001 Ah 2 , mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0092 Ah, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0122 Ah, and a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 99.66%, demonstrating strong robustness and predictive capability. This research overcomes the traditional reliance on full cycles, demonstrating the effectiveness of short charging segments combined with intelligent optimization algorithms. The proposed method offers a high-precision, low-cost solution for online battery health monitoring and rapid sorting of retired batteries, highlighting its significant engineering application potential.

Research Progress on the Influence of Cathode Materials on Thermal Runaway Behavior of Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Yanru Yang, Yang Gao, Yu Miao, Yuan Liang, Xiaoqiang Ren",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11100373,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/373/pdf?version=1760262121,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/373,,"The structure, chemical composition, thermal stability, and abuse responses of cathode materials are critical to the safety and economy of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This review systematically summarizes advances in research on how cathode materials influence LIB thermal runaway (TR) behavior. It analyzes the oxygen release from cathodes in TR mechanisms and the hazards of such oxygen generation during TR, expounds on how differences in cathode structure, chemical composition, and thermal stability affect TR behavior, and summarizes the thermal characteristics of LIBs with different cathodes under mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuse. Results indicate that oxygen released from cathode decomposition during TR oxidizes electrolytes, releasing substantial heat and gas and causing more severe TR hazards. Structural instability of cathodes leads to accelerated release of lattice oxygen, speeding up TR initiation. Chemical composition regulates thermal stability, phase transition pathways, and gas generation rates during TR, while elemental ratios affect the ease of TR triggering. Cathodes with poor thermal stability have lower thermal decomposition onset temperatures, making TR more likely to occur and intensifying reaction severity. All three abuse types trigger inherent risks of cathodes, inducing TR and significantly increasing its occurrence probability. Differences in intrinsic properties further extend to the system level, also influencing thermal runaway propagation and fire dynamics at the module level. Future research focusing on the intrinsic properties of cathodes and external abuse is of great significance for addressing LIB TR behavior. Full article"
Multi-Timescale Estimation of SOE and SOH for Lithium-Ion Batteries with a Fractional-Order Model and Multi-Innovation Filter Framework,"Jing Yu, Fang Yao",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11100372,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/372/pdf?version=1760172895,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/10/372,,"Based on a fractional-order equivalent circuit model, this paper proposes a multi-timescale collaborative State of Energy (SOE) and State of Health (SOH) estimation method (FOASTFREKF-EKF) for lithium batteries to mitigate the influence of model inaccuracies and battery aging on SOE estimation. Initially, a fractional-order equivalent circuit model is built, and its parameters are identified offline using the Starfish Optimization Algorithm (SFOA) to establish a high-fidelity battery model. An H∞ filter is then integrated to improve the algorithm’s resilience to external disturbances. Furthermore, an adaptive noise covariance adjustment mechanism is employed to reduce the effect of operational noise, and a time-varying attenuation factor is introduced to improve the algorithm’s tracking and convergence capabilities during abrupt system-state changes. A joint estimator is subsequently constructed, which uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the online determination of battery parameters and SOH assessment. This approach minimizes the effect of varying model parameters on SOE accuracy while reducing computational load through multi-timescale methods. Experimental validation under diverse operating conditions shows that the proposed algorithm achieves root mean square errors (RMSE) of less than 0.21% for SOE and 0.31% for SOH. These findings demonstrate that the method provides high accuracy and reliability under complex operating conditions. Full article"

A critical element in battery system design is the structural housing, which must provide effective impact protection to ensure passenger safety and prevent catastrophic failures. This study examines the impact response of an innovative sheet molding compound (SMC) composite battery housing, manufactured from an Elium resin modified with Martinal ATH matrix, reinforced with glass fibers, that combines fire resistance and recyclability, unlike conventional thermoset and metallic housings. The material was characterized through standardized mechanical tests, and its impact performance was evaluated via drop-weight experiments on plates and a full-scale housing. The impact tests were conducted at varying energy levels to induce barely visible impact damage (BVID) and visible impact damage (VID). A finite element model was developed in LS-DYNA using the experimentally derived material properties and was validated against the impact tests. Parametric simulations of ground and pole collisions revealed the critical velocity thresholds at which housing deformation begins to affect the first battery cells, while lower-energy impacts were absorbed without compromising the pack. The study provides one of the first combined experimental and numerical assessments of Elium SMC in battery enclosures, emphasizing its potential as a sustainable alternative for next-generation battery systems for transport applications.

However, the industrial production of SC-NCM faces challenges such as lengthy processing steps, high manufacturing costs, and inconsistent product quality. In this study, we innovatively propose a metal/organic framework (MOF)-mediated one-step synthesis strategy to achieve controllable structural preparation and in situ Nb 5+ doping in SC-NCM. Using a Ni–Co–Mn-based MOF as both precursor and self-template, we precisely regulated the thermal treatment pathway to guide the nucleation and oriented growth of high-density SC-NCM particles. Simultaneously, Nb 5+ was pre-anchored within the MOF framework, enabling atomic-level homogeneous doping into the transition metal layers during crystal growth. Exceptional electrochemical performance is revealed in the in situ Nb-doped SC-NCM, with an initial discharge capacity reaching 176 mAh/g at a 1C rate and a remarkable capacity retention of 86.36% maintained after 200 cycles. This study paves a versatile and innovative pathway for the design of high-stability, high-energy-density cathode materials via a MOF-mediated synthesis strategy, enabling precise manipulation of both morphology and chemical composition.

Traditional SOH prediction methods face limitations in real-time adjustment and accuracy under complex operating conditions. By determining electrode capacity loss and identifying complex patterns that traditional methods struggle to detect, prediction accuracy can be improved. Based on electrode capacity matching and compensation relationships, this paper proposes an electrode capacity balance model to evaluate battery development trends and degradation during cycling. We use q Li − q p state assessment as a trend criterion, q p to quantify aging, and Q c to identify thermal runaway risk levels, developing more efficient SOH prediction indicators and methods to ensure battery safety and performance.

A novel parameter, the characteristic relaxation time, derived from DRT analysis, is introduced to enhance SOH estimation. By analyzing the ratio of the central relaxation time (τ) between the charge transfer and diffusion peaks, the battery status can be determined without the need for historical data. Experimental data from lithium-ion batteries, including 18650 cells and LR2032 coin cells, were examined until the end of their life. Nyquist and DRT plots across various frequency ranges revealed consistent aging trends, particularly in the charge transfer and diffusion processes. These processes appeared as shifting and merging peaks in the DRT plots, signifying progressive degradation. A polynomial equation fitted to the τ ratio graph achieved a high accuracy (Adj. R 2 = 0.9994), enabling reliable battery lifespan prediction. Validation with a Samsung Galaxy S9+ battery demonstrated that the method could estimate its remaining life, predicting a total lifespan of approximately 2100 cycles (compared to 1000 cycles already completed). These results confirm that SOH estimation is feasible without prior data and highlight the potential of DRT analysis for accurate and quantitative prediction of battery longevity. Full article"

Despite its high carbon content, raw Pit contains significant impurities and has irregular particle morphology, which limits its direct application in batteries. We employed a multi-step, additive-free refinement process—including jet milling, spheroidization, and high-temperature graphitization—to enhance carbon purity and structural properties. The processed Pit-derived graphite showed a much-improved particle size distribution (D50 reduced from 25.3 μm to 14.8 μm & Span reduced from 1.72 to 1.23), increased tap density (from 0.54 to 0.80 g/cm 3 ), and reduced BET surface area, making it suitable for high-performance lithium-ion batteries anodes. Structural characterization by XRD and TEM confirmed dramatically enhanced crystallinity after graphitization (graphitization degree increasing from ~13 for raw Pit to 95.7% for graphitized Pit at 3000 °C). The fully processed graphite (denoted S_Pit3000) delivered a reversible discharge capacity of 346.7 mAh/g with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.5% in half-cell tests—comparable to commercial artificial graphite. Furthermore, when composited with silicon oxide to form a hybrid anode, the material achieved an even higher capacity of 418.0 mAh/g under high mass loading conditions. These results highlight the feasibility of transforming industrial coke waste into value-added electrode materials through environmentally friendly physical processes. The upcycled graphite anode meets industrial performance standards, demonstrating a promising route toward circular economy solutions in both the steel and battery industries. Full article"

In solid-state batteries (SSBs), they combine metallic-level conductivity (>10 3 S cm −1 ), adjustable surface terminations, and mechanical resilience, which makes them suitable for diverse functions within the cell architecture. Current studies have shown that MXene-based anodes can deliver reversible lithium storage with Coulombic efficiencies approaching ~98% over 500 cycles, while their use as conductive additives in cathodes significantly improves electron transport and rate capability. As interfacial layers or structural scaffolds, MXenes effectively buffer volume fluctuations and suppress lithium dendrite growth, contributing to extended cycle life. In solid polymer and composite electrolytes, MXene fillers have been reported to increase Li + conductivity to the 10 −3 –10 −2 S cm −1 range and enhance Li + transference numbers (up to ~0.76), thereby improving both ionic transport and mechanical stability. Beyond established Ti-based systems, double transition metal MXenes (e.g., Mo 2 TiC 2 , Mo 2 Ti 2 C 3 ) and hybrid heterostructures offer expanded opportunities for tailoring interfacial chemistry and optimizing energy density. Despite these advances, large-scale deployment remains constrained by high synthesis costs (often exceeding USD 200–400 kg −1 for Ti 3 C 2 T x at lab scale), restacking effects, and stability concerns, highlighting the need for greener etching processes, robust quality control, and integration with existing gigafactory production lines. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for enabling MXene-based SSBs to transition from laboratory prototypes to commercially viable, safe, and high-performance energy storage systems. Beyond summarizing performance, this review elucidates the mechanistic roles of MXenes in SSBs—linking lithiophilicity, field homogenization, and interphase formation to dendrite suppression at Li|SSE interfaces, and termination-assisted salt dissociation, segmental-motion facilitation, and MWS polarization to enhanced electrolyte conductivity—thereby providing a clear design rationale for practical implementation.

Given that lithium-ion batteries operate under relatively benign conditions, conventional rapid cooling does not significantly affect the property variations in their internal electrode materials during normal use. However, thermal runaway presents an exception due to its dramatic temperature fluctuations from room temperature to several hundred degrees Celsius. In this study, we investigated NCM811 cathodes in 18,650 batteries subjected to transient thermal runaway followed by rapid cooling using several advanced analytical techniques. The results reveal a phenomenon characterized by intergranular cracking within NCM811 cathode materials when exposed to rapid cooling during transient thermal runaway. Furthermore, lithium-ion cells utilizing reused NCM-182.4 electrodes in fresh electrolyte demonstrate a reversible capacity of 231.4 mAh/g after 30 cycles at 0.1 C, highlighting the potential for reusing NCM811 cathodes in the lithium-ion battery recycling process. These findings not only illustrate that NCM811 particles may experience intergranular cracking when subjected to rapid cooling during transient thermal runaway, but also the rapidly cooled NCM811 electrodes exhibit potential for reuse.

While evolving systems can offer adequate adaptability to the nonstationary and nonlinear behavior of battery degradation, existing methods often face challenges such as uncontrolled rule growth, limited adaptability, and reduced accuracy under noisy conditions. To address these limitations, this paper presents a smart evolving fuzzy predictor with customized firefly optimization (SEFP-FO) to provide a better solution for battery RUL prediction. The proposed SEFP-FO technique introduces two main contributions: (1) An activation- and distance-aware penalization strategy is proposed to govern rule evolution by evaluating the structural relevance of incoming data. This mechanism can control rule growth while maintaining model convergence. (2) A customized firefly algorithm is suggested to optimize the antecedent parameters of newly generated fuzzy rules, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy and improving the predictor’s adaptive capability to time-varying system conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed SEFP-FO technique is first validated by simulation using nonlinear benchmark datasets, which is then applied to Li-ion battery RUL predictions. Full article"

Carbon activation was carried out using potassium hydroxide (KOH) at varying mass ratios of KOH to precursor material: 1:1, 2:1, and 5:1 for both WH and MC-derived carbon. The physical properties (X-ray diffraction patterns, BET surface area, micropore and mesopore volume, conductivity, etc.) and electrochemical performance (specific capacity, discharge at various current rates, electrochemical impedance measurement, etc.) were determined. Material characterization revealed that the activated carbon derived from MC exhibits an amorphous structure, whereas that obtained from WH is predominantly crystalline. High specific surface areas were achieved with activated carbons synthesized using a low KOH-to-carbon mass ratio (1:1), reaching 413.03 m 2 ·g −1 for WH and 216.34 m 2 ·g −1 for MC. However, larger average pore diameters were observed at higher activation ratios (5:1), measuring 8.38 nm for KOH/WH and 5.28 nm for KOH/MC. For both biomass-derived carbons, optimal electrical conductivity was obtained at a 2:1 activation ratio, with values of 14.7 × 10 −3 S·cm −1 for KOH/WH and 8.42 × 10 −3 S·cm −1 for KOH/MC. The electrochemical performance of coin cells based on cathodes composed of 85% LiFePO 4 , 8% of these activated carbons, and 7% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a binder, with lithium metal as the anode were studied. The LiFePO 4 /C (LFP/C) cathodes exhibited specific capacities of up to 160 mAh·g −1 at a current rate of C/12 and 110 mAh·g −1 at 5C. Both LFP/MC and LFP/WH cathodes exhibit optimal energy density at specific values of pore size, pore volume, charge transfer resistance (R ct ), and diffusion coefficient (D Li ), reflecting a favorable balance between ionic transport, accessible surface area, and charge conduction. Maximum energy densities relative to active mass were recorded at 544 mWh·g −1 for LFP/MC 2:1, 554 mWh·g −1 for LFP/WH 2:1, and 568 mWh·g −1 for the reference LFP/graphite system. These performance results demonstrate that the development of high-performing bio-sourced activated carbon depends on the optimization of various parameters, including chemical composition, specific surface area, pore volume and size distribution, as well as electrical conductivity.

A coupled electrochemical–thermal–mechanical model was established to study the concentration and stress distributions of negative electrode particles under different charging rates and ambient temperatures. The results show that during charging, the maximum lithium-ion concentration occurs on the particle surface, while the minimum concentration appears at the particle center. Moreover, as the temperature decreases, the concentration distribution of negative electrode active particles becomes more uneven. Stress analysis indicates that when charging at a rate of 1C and 0 °C, the maximum stress of particles at the negative electrode–separator interface reaches 123.7 MPa, while when charging at 30 °C, the maximum particle stress is 24.3 MPa. The maximum shear stress occurs at the particle center, presenting a tensile stress state, while the minimum shear stress is located on the particle surface, showing a compressive stress state. Finally, to manage the stress of active materials in lithium-ion batteries while charging for health maintenance, this study uses a DNN (Deep Neural Network) to predict the maximum shear stress of particles based on simulation results. The predicted indicators, MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), are 0.034 and 0.046, respectively. This research is helpful for optimizing charging strategies based on the stress of active materials in lithium-ion batteries during charging, inhibiting battery aging and improving safety performance.

These issues severely limit the cycle life and pose a major barrier to large-scale industrial deployment. Integration of porous anode structures and electrode additives—two widely investigated approaches for mitigating challenges related to zinc anode—shows significant promise. However, effectively combining these approaches remains challenging. This study introduces a method for fabricating zinc anodes that can combine the benefits of a porous structure and electrode additive. The polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer binder used in fabricating the anode material resulted in a stable scaffold, providing the desired anode porosity of approximately 60% and effectively anchoring ZnO nanoparticles. The zinc anodes prepared using a nickel mesh current collector without any electrode additives demonstrated stable cycling performance, sustaining 350 cycles at a current density of 60 mA g Zn −1 with a coulombic efficiency of approximately 95%. Incorporating 2 wt.% Bi 2 O 3 as an electrode additive further enhanced the cycling performance, achieving 200 stable cycles with 100% coulombic efficiency under an increased current density of 120 mA g Zn −1 , signifying the effectiveness of the proposed fabrication strategy.

Poor thermal management can lead to elevated cell temperatures, accelerating side reactions, reducing cell lifetime, and, in extreme cases, causing thermal runaway. Therefore, understanding heat generation is crucial for the commercialization of emerging battery materials. Due to its high energy density, lithium–nickel–manganese–oxide (LNMO) is an attractive candidate for next-generation cathode materials; however, the composition of its heat generation is not yet fully understood. To address this, the state-of-charge (SoC)-dependent entropy coefficient and resistance of disordered LNMO cathodes are determined using the potentiometric method. The results show that both values are strongly influenced by the redox reactions of Ni and Mn. The entropy coefficient varies between 5.2 and −32.4 J mol − 1 K − 1 , depending on the SoC. Furthermore, the resistance exhibits a switching dependence on kinetics and mass transfer. The resulting heat flux calculations indicate that, at SoC < 20%, heat generation is dominated by the kinetic behavior of LNMO, leading to two exothermal peaks during discharge and one exothermal peak during charge. This behavior is validated through a comparison with a low-current calorimetric measurement. Full article"

Silicate-based ceramics have recently gained attention for their favourable properties, including better ionic conduction and wider stability windows. In this study, 10% Pr 3+ and Nd 3+ were doped into sodium gadolinium silicate ceramics to examine the effects on phase purity, ionic conductivity, and interfacial compatibility with sodium metal anodes. The materials were synthesized via solid-state methods and sintered at 950–1075 °C to study the impact of sintering temperature on densification and microstructure.

The impact of the thicknesses of the positive current collector, negative current collector, separator, and aluminum laminate package on cell properties is presented. The impact of these materials varies greatly over different cell designs, with one of the largest impacts being from a decrease in separator material thickness, especially in cells with a high number of electrode pairs, specifically, cells with a larger thickness or cells with low-capacity loadings. For high-capacity positive electrode loading, a decrease in separator thickness from 16 to 8 microns results in an increase in stack volumetric energy density from 502 to 531 Wh/L or an increase of 5.7%.

All lithium-based batteries produce flammable vent gas as a result of failure through thermal runaway. LFP cells produce less gas by volume than nickel-based cells, but the composition of this gas most often contains less carbon dioxide and more hydrogen. However, when LFP cells fail, they generate lower temperatures, so the vent gas is rarely ignited. Therefore, the hazard presented by a LFP cell in thermal runaway is less of a direct battery fire hazard but more of a flammable gas source hazard. This research identified the constituents and components of the vent gas for different sized LFP prismatic cells when overcharged to failure. This data was used to calculate the maximum homogenous concentration of gas that would be released into a 1.73 m 3 test rig and the percentage of the lower explosive limit (LEL). Overcharge experiments were conducted using the same type of cells in the test rig in the presence of remote ignition sources. Ignition and deflagration of the vent gas were possible at concentrations below the theoretical LEL of the vent gas if it was homogeneously mixed. Full article"

This study aims to develop an integrated co-simulation framework to support the design, debugging, and validation of EIS measurement systems devoted to the online monitoring of battery cells, helping to predict experimental results and identify/correct the non-ideality effects and sources of uncertainty. The proposed framework models both the hardware and software components of an EIS-based system to simulate and analyze the impedance measurement process as a whole. It takes into consideration the effects of physical non-idealities on the hardware–software interactions and how those affect the final impedance estimate, offering a tool to refine designs and interpret test results. For validation purposes, the proposed general framework is applied to a specific EIS-based laboratory prototype, previously designed by the research group. The framework is first used to debug the prototype by uncovering hidden non-idealities, thus refining the measurement system, and then employed as a digital model of the latter for fast development of software algorithms. Finally, the results of the co-simulation framework are compared against a theoretical model, the real prototype, and a benchtop instrument to assess the global accuracy of the framework.

A coupled finite-element model implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 was used to integrate spherical lithium diffusion, charge conservation, and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation kinetics. The evaluated anode structure consisted of a 60 µm-thick bilayer: a 30 µm graphite surface layer coupled with a 30 µm inner layer of alternative active materials. Simulations were performed using an NMC622 cathode, LiPF 6 in EC:EMC electrolyte, at room temperature, under a charge rate of 1 C, considering realistic particle sizes (graphite: 2.5 µm; Si: 0.1 µm; hard carbon: 2.5 µm; LTO: 0.2 µm; Li metal: 0.5 µm), and evaluated over 2000 cycles. The hard carbon/graphite configuration exhibited a capacity fade of 5.8% compared with 7.1% in pure graphite. Additionally, the SEI thickness decreased to 0.20 µm (from 0.25 µm), the overpotential dropped to −17 mV (from −59 mV), and the electrolyte consumption was reduced to 20.8% (from 42.9%). The analysis highlights hard carbon and LTO inner layers as optimal trade-offs between capacity and cycle stability, whereas silicon and lithium metal significantly increased the initial capacity but accelerated SEI formation and impedance growth. These findings demonstrate the graphite-buffered bilayer’s potential to decouple interfacial degradation from high-capacity materials, providing valuable guidelines for the design of advanced lithium-ion battery anodes.

Recent studies have shown that the use of high-concentration electrolytes can suppress the decomposition reaction of electrolytes and help enhance cell reversibility. However, the fundamental nature of concentrated electrolytes’ ability to improve the chemical durability and stability of Li-O 2 batteries remains unclear. In this work, we conducted computational studies to elucidate the origin of the enhanced oxidative/reductive stability of three representative solvents—DMSO, DME, and EC—in high-concentration electrolytes. The modeling results identify that Li + -solvent complexes, one of the solvate components, are the easiest to decompose in concentrated electrolytes. Thermodynamic and kinetic characterizations reveal that more anions in concentrated electrolytes are responsible for improving the oxidative and reductive stability of electrolytes. In addition, more Li + ions, acting as a scavenging or stabilizing agent for superoxide anion (O 2 − ), also improve the stability of electrolytes against oxidation in Li-O 2 batteries. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the enhanced cycle stability of a Li-O 2 battery using high-concentration electrolytes. Full article"

To address the complex nonlinear degradation behavior associated with battery aging, this study proposes a novel RUL prediction framework that integrates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with an ensemble learning algorithm. The approach first applies EEMD to decompose aging data into a residual component and several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The residual component is then modeled using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, while the Kolmogorov–Arnold network (KAN) focuses on learning from the IMF components. These individual predictions are subsequently combined to reconstruct the overall capacity degradation trajectory. Experimental validation on real lithium-ion battery aging datasets demonstrates that the proposed method provides highly accurate RUL predictions, exhibits strong robustness, and effectively captures nonlinear characteristics under varying operating conditions. Specifically, the method achieves R 2 above 0.96 with absolute RUL errors within 2–3 cycles on NASA datasets, and maintains R 2 values above 0.91 with errors within 7–15 cycles on CALCE datasets. Furthermore, the optimal KAN hyperparameters for different IMF components are identified, offering valuable insights for multi-scale modeling and future model optimization. Full article"

This study assesses the techno-economic and environmental viability of second-life battery energy storage systems (SLBESS) in a California commercial building, using one year of operational data. SLBESS performance is compared with equivalent new battery systems under identical dispatch strategies, building load profiles, and time-of-use tariff structures. A dispatch-aware framework integrates multi-year battery simulations, degradation modeling, electricity cost analysis, and life cycle assessment based on marginal grid emissions. The economic analysis quantifies the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and operational levelized cost of storage (LCOS op ). Results show that SLBESS achieve 49.2% higher NPV, 41.9% higher IRR, and 13.8% lower LCOS op than new batteries, despite their lower round-trip efficiency. SLBESS reduce embodied emissions by 41% and achieve 8% lower carbon intensity than new batteries. Sensitivity analysis identifies that economic outcomes are driven primarily by financial parameters (incentives, acquisition cost) rather than technical factors (degradation, initial health), providing a clear rationale for policies that reduce upfront costs. Environmentally, grid emission factors are the dominant driver. Battery degradation rate and initial state of health have minimal impact, suggesting that technical concerns may be overstated. These findings provide actionable insights for deploying cost-effective, low-carbon storage in commercial buildings. Full article"

The proposed algorithm is based on shifting the Droop reference voltages and prevents the simultaneous charging and discharging of the batteries. This approach is not only practical but also highly versatile, as it is compatible with all converters as long as the Droop voltage can be changed remotely, and a current measurement is provided to a central controller. No further programming access to the DC/DCs is necessary. There is no need for nonlinear or different-valued Droop resistances for charging and discharging. The balancing approach is validated via simulation in MATLAB/Simulink 2024a.The results show that the proposed approach achieves SoC balancing without degrading the dynamic performance of the grid.

Conventional single-state Kalman filters are prone to parameter drift caused by cell aging, which leads to persistent SOC estimation errors. This study compares two dual-estimator methods, the Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) and the Dual Unscented Kalman Filter (DUKF), for simultaneous SOC and SOH estimation using a second-order equivalent-circuit model. The process and measurement covariance matrices were tuned through a structured optimization procedure to ensure consistent performance under different drive cycles and initialization errors. To mitigate the weak voltage sensitivity to capacity, synthetic SOC–capacity coupling was introduced to enhance SOH observability and accelerate convergence. Simulations conducted under the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) and a real-world CLUST7 profile demonstrated SOC root-mean-square errors near 2% for both filters. The DUKF achieved faster and smoother convergence than the DEKF but required roughly fivefold higher computational cost. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting dual Kalman filtering as an effective framework for accurate and robust SOC/SOH estimation in production battery management systems.

Conventional state-of-the-art EIS methods involve applying a sequence of sinusoidal excitation signals, ranging from very low to very high frequencies, to capture the impedance response of the battery. However, this process is time-consuming, often requiring several hours to complete. Alternatively, approaches using pulse-based excitation have shown promise in reducing test time but often suffer from challenges in handling measurement noise and poor frequency resolution, especially at low frequencies. This work presents an improved rectangular pulse-based impedance characterization technique that enhances low-frequency resolution, increases robustness to noise, and reduces experimental time. This is accomplished through the following three key contributions of this paper: First, it establishes statistical noise properties in the Fourier-transformed signals, enabling effective noise reduction through averaging. Second, it proposes a log-frequency clustering approach to average impedance data, enhancing the accuracy of the impedance spectrum. Third, it presents a systematic pulse design method using the knowledge of the approximate time constants of the system to select the sampling interval, pulse width, and rest duration for reduced test time, improved low-frequency resolution, and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Together, the proposed approach enables faster and more accurate impedance characterization. Simulation analysis and experimental results confirm that the proposed approach enhances spectral resolution at low frequencies, mitigates the impact of noise at high frequencies, and significantly improves the reliability of impedance estimates at a faster measurement time frame.

One-Step Electrospun LTO Anode for Flexible Li-Ion Batteries,"Edi Edna Mados, Roni Amit, Noy Kluska, Diana Golodnitsky, Amit Sitt",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110405,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/405/pdf?version=1762265809,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/405,,"Fiber-based and fabric batteries signify a groundbreaking development in energy storage, allowing for the straightforward incorporation of power sources into wearable fabrics, intelligent apparel, and adaptable electronics. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy for one-step fabrication of a flexible lithium titanate oxide (Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , LTO) anode directly on a copper current collector via electrospinning, eliminating the need for high-temperature post-processing. Based on our previous work with electrospun nanofiber cathodes and carbon-based current collector, we prepared the LTO electrode using polyethylene oxide (PEO) as a binder and carbon additives to enhance mechanical integrity and conductivity. LTO fiber mats detached from the current collector were found to endure multiple instances of bending, twisting, and folding without any structural damage. LTO/Li cells incorporating electrospun fiber LTO electrodes with 72 wt% active material loading deliver a high capacity of 170 mAh g −1 at 0.05 C. In addition, they demonstrate excellent cycling stability with a capacity loss of only 0.01% per cycle over 200 cycles and maintain a capacity of 160 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C. The scalability of the heat-treatment-free method for fabricating flexible LTO anodes, together with the improved mechanical durability and electrochemical performance, offers a promising route toward the development of next-generation flexible and wearable energy storage devices.

A Novel Efficient Grading of Spent Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectrometry,"Ote Amuta, Julia Kowal",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110404,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/404/pdf?version=1762415487,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/404,,"With the increasing adoption of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as the batteries of choice in electromobility, personal electronic devices, and so on, comes the challenge of ageing, which prevents the batteries from performing optimally and meeting the design intent. This is observed in the form of declining power capability due to the increase in resistance and the reduction in capacity that can be stored or discharged from them. Unfortunately, the cost of assessing batteries after the first use remains a daunting challenge. In our work, we propose an approach that carries out fast preliminary grading based on resistance and capacity by first connecting old cells of the same chemistry and model in series with resistors to limit the branch current, then connecting the branches in parallel to equalise the voltages. A Simulink model of NCR18650PF Panasonic cells with adaptive-series resistance is compared with a fixed-series resistance and found to improve the balancing time from over 24 h to just 8 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on the individual balanced cells between 0.1 Hz and 5 kHz so that the real impedance, imaginary impedance, absolute impedance, and phase were compared with the SOH of the cells at each frequency. Results show that the imaginary impedance in the 6.6 Hz frequency range shows a good correlation coefficient > 0.98 with the SOH, especially with a state of charge (SOC) of about 75–85% for the LCO cells. By selecting only a sample from all the cells that covers a wide range of ages and carrying out a full-capacity checkup on them, a simple correlation with the SOH and the EIS measurements for different frequencies can be used to estimate the SOH of the other cells that were connected in the same parallel connection. This is a considerable time saving in the charge and discharge time on the other cells in facilities that lack the capacity for simultaneous cycling of all cells. There are also huge energy savings in not having to cycle all the cells. Therefore, it offers a more efficient approach to grading spent cells than carrying out full capacity tests. Full article"

The generation of microstructured channels within the electrodes creates shorter pathways for lithium-ion diffusion and mitigates strain from volume expansion during electrochemical cycling. The topography modification enables faster charging, improved rate capability, and the potential to combine high-power and high-energy properties. In this study, we present a preliminary exploration of this approach for sodium-ion battery technology, focusing on the impact of laser-generated channels on hard carbon electrodes in sodium-metal half-cells. The performance was analyzed by employing different conditions, including different electrolytes, separators, and electrodes with varying compaction degrees. To identify key factors contributing to rate capability improvements, we conducted a comparative analysis of laser-structured and unstructured electrodes using methods including scanning electron microscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, and electrochemical cycling. Despite being based on a limited sample size, the data reveal promising trends and serve as a basis for further optimization. Our findings suggest that laser structuring can enhance rate capability, particularly under conditions of limited electrolyte wetting or increased electrode density. This highlights the potential of laser structuring to optimize electrode design for next-generation sodium-ion batteries and other post-lithium technologies. Full article"

This review focuses on recent progress in diversifying redox-active species to overcome these limits, highlighting chemistries that increase overall cell voltage, energy density, and efficiency while maintaining long cycle life and safety. The study dwells deeper into manganese-based systems (e.g., Mn/Ti, Mn/V, Mn/S, M/Zn) that leverage Mn’s high positive potential while addressing Mn(III) disproportionation reactions; iron-based hybrids (Fe/Cr, Fe/Zn, Fe/Pb, Fe/V, Fe/S, Fe/Cd) that exploit the low cost, and its abundance, along with membrane and electrolyte strategies to prevent the potential issue involving crossover; cerium-anchored catholytes (Ce/Pb, V/Ce, Eu/Ce, Ce/S, Ce/Zn) that deliver high operational voltage by implementing an acid-base media, along with selective zeolite membranes; and halide systems (Zn–I, Zn–Br, Sn–Br, polysulfide–bromine/iodide) that combine fast redox kinetics and high solubility with advances such as carbon-coated membranes, bromine complexation, and ambipolar electrolytes. Across these various families of RFBs, the review highlights the modifications made to the flow-fields, membranes, and electrodes by utilizing a zero-gap serpentine flow field, sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membranes, carbon-modified and zeolite separators, electrolyte additives to enhance the voltage (VE%), and thereby energy (EE%) efficiency, while reducing the overall system cost. These modifications to the existing RFB technology offer a promising alternative to traditional approaches, paving the way for improved performance and widespread adoption of RFB technology in large-scale grid-based energy storage solutions.

Traditional recycling processes use toxic and corrosive inorganic acids for leaching, generating toxic waste streams. The low-value feedstocks will be LFP-rich with contamination from lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) and lithium–nickel–manganese–cobalt oxide (NMC) battery chemistries. Overall, the lower-value feedstock coupled with the need to reduce environmentally damaging waste streams requires the development of robust, green leaching processes capable of selectively targeting the LFP and LCO/NMC battery chemistries. This research concluded that a first-stage oxalic acid leach could selectively extract Al, Li, and P from the industrially sourced LFP-rich black mass. When operating at the optimal conditions (0.5 M oxalic acid, 5% solids, pH 0.8, and an agitation speed of 600 rpm), >99% of the Li and P and >97% of the Al were selectively extracted after 2 h, while Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, and Co extractions were kept relatively low, namely, at 19%, <3%, <1%, 0%, and 0%. This research also explored a second-stage leach to treat the first-stage leach residue using ascorbic acid, citric acid, and glycine. It was concluded that when leaching with glycine (30 g/L glycine, a temperature of 40 °C, an agitation speed of 600 rpm, and 2% solids at pH 9.6), that >97% of the Co, >77% of the Ni, and 41% of the Mn were extracted, while the co-extraction percentages of Cu, Fe, and Al were <27%, <4%, and <2%.

The deposition process transforms commercial graphite target material into carbon polymorph (CALIB) layers, interposed with silicon layers deposited in situ from a silicon source, thereby forming high-capacity anodes for Li ion batteries. Composite CALIB-C/Si 4 anodes with a layered architecture exhibited a first-cycle specific capacity of over 1550 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 and retained a capacity of ~1080 mAh g −1 at a 1 A g −1 rate after 200 cycles. Detailed structural characterisation revealed a disordered carbon matrix encompassing nanosized sp 2 -bonded carbon clusters (average size ~20 nm), cross-linked by a network of sp 3 -bonded atomic sites, with predominant mesoporosity and high surface area. The silicon layers were found to consist of an amorphous Si matrix with embedded nanocrystalline components, emulating the growth mode of the CALIB buffer. The presence of the mesoporous carbon matrix accommodated the stress caused by the alloying/de-alloying of silicon nanolayers, thereby alleviating the pulverisation effect and preserving the structural integrity of the composite. The initial performance and capacity decay of the anodes were found to depend on the thickness of the CALIB-C buffer interlayers. Full article"

This review synthesizes recent advances in liquid electrolyte design for stabilizing Si anodes, emphasizing three key pillars: (i) Lithium salts that enable anion-derived inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers with high fracture toughness; (ii) Solvent systems including carbonates, ethers, and phosphonates, where fluorination and steric hindrance tailor SEI elasticity; (iii) Functional additives (F/B/Si-containing) that form mechanically compliant interphases and scavenge detrimental species.

Thermal Runaway Propagation in Pouch-Type Lithium-Ion Battery Modules: Effects of State of Charge and Initiation Location,"So-Jin Kim, Yeong-Seok Yu, Chan-Seok Jeong, Sang-Bum Lee, Yong-Un Na",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110398,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/398/pdf?version=1761642747,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/398,,"The widespread adoption of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy-storage systems (ESSs) has raised growing concern about fire hazards caused by thermal runaway (TR). While many studies have examined cell-level TR mechanisms, investigations at the module level remain limited despite their importance for safety design. In this study, TR propagation was experimentally analyzed in a 12-cell (2p6s) pouch-type LIB module with EV-grade cells. The state of charge (SOC) and initiation location were the main variables. TR was initiated by a surface-mounted Kapton heating film, with power increased stepwise from 63 W to 141 W at 5-min intervals. Temperature, voltage, and heat release rate (HRR) were continuously monitored. Results showed that higher SOC led to earlier TR onset, shorter vent-to-ignition delay, and stronger combustion with jet flames. Center initiation produced rapid bidirectional propagation with a peak heat release rate (PHRR) of 590 kW and a propagation time of 107 s, whereas edge initiation caused slower unidirectional spread with a PHRR of 105 kW and a propagation time of 338 s. These results demonstrate that both SOC and initiation location critically control TR severity and propagation, providing essential data for EV fire safety evaluation and module design. Full article"
Numerical Investigation into 18650 Li-Ion Battery Temperature Control Applying Immersion Cooling with FC-40 Dielectric Fluid,"Sara El Afia, Rachid Hidki, Francisco Jurado, Antonio Cano-Ortega",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110397,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/397/pdf?version=1761637646,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/397,,"Nowadays, immersion cooling-based battery thermal management systems have demonstrated their effectiveness in controlling the temperature of lithium-ion batteries. While previous scientific research has primarily concentrated on traditional dielectric fluids such as mineral oil, the current research investigates the effectiveness of the dielectric fluid FC-40. A three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics model of an eight-cell 18650 battery system was constructed using ANSYS Fluent 19.2 to examine the effect of cooling fluids (air, mineral oil, and FC-40), velocity of flow (0.01 m/s to 0.15 m/s), discharge rate (1C to 5C), and inlet/outlet size (2.5 mm to 3.5 mm) on thermal efficiency as well as pressure drop. The findings indicate that employing FC-40 as the dielectric fluid significantly reduces the peak cell temperature, with an absolute decrease of 2.80 °C compared to mineral oil and 15.10 °C compared to air. Furthermore, FC-40 achieves the highest uniformity with minimal hotspot. On the other hand, as the fluid velocity increases, the maximum temperature of the battery drops, reaching a minimum of 26 °C at a velocity of 0.15 m/s. Otherwise, at lower flow velocities, the pressure drop remains minimal, thereby reducing the pumping power consumption. Additionally, increasing the inlet and outlet diameter of the fluid directly improves cooling uniformity. Consequently, the temperature dropped by up to 4.3%. Finally, the findings demonstrate that elevated discharge rates contribute to increased heat dissipation but adversely affect the efficiency of the thermal management system. This study provides critical knowledge for the enhancement of battery thermal management systems based on immersion cooling using FC-40 as a dielectric. Full article"

This paper conducts research on the aging evolution and safety characteristics of LIBs under low-temperature conditions (−20 °C), to reveal the change laws of battery degradation and the trends of thermal parameters of aging LIBs. Cycling and charging/discharging experiments under low temperatures were conducted to collect realistic battery data. Various factors such as temperature, cycle number, charging/discharging rate, and depth of discharge/charge (DOD/DOC) are taken into consideration to test the battery cycling and thermal performance. With collected experimental results, basic electrical states of LIBs such as open-circuit voltage (OCV), internal resistance, and capacity are presented. Then, the capacity loss and internal resistance growth are also described and analyzed under various charge/discharge rates and DODs/DOCs. The experimental results show that low temperatures cause an almost 30% increase in polarization resistance, with nonlinear changes in total internal resistance. Moreover, the battery capacity and internal resistance also have extreme points with different charge/discharge rates under −20 °C, which may demonstrate that the charge/discharge rates of LIBs can be optimized under low temperature. Thermal runaway (TR) experiments were also conducted, and the self-heating rate and other indices are presented to show that an aging battery under low temperature still holds large energy to develop TR. The aging trends of LIBs under low temperatures are summarized, and battery safety is clarified to provide a reference for battery lifetime and safety management under low-temperature conditions.

However, the realization of these benefits critically depends on the implementation of sophisticated control algorithms. From fundamental rule-based systems to advanced predictive and intelligent control strategies, the evolution and integration of these algorithms are driven by the need to efficiently manage the power flow, optimize energy utilization and ensure the long-term reliability of hybrid energy storage systems. This study briefly presents (in the form of a mini review) the research in this field and the development directions and application of state-of-the-art control algorithms, also highlighting the needs, challenges and future development directions. Based on the analysis made, it is found that from the point of view of performance vs. ease of implementation and computational resource requirements, fuzzy algorithms are the most suitable for HESS control in the case of common applications. However, when the performance requirements of HESSs relate to special and high-tech applications, HESS control will be achieved by using convolutional neural networks.

Optimal DC Fast-Charging Strategies for Battery Electric Vehicles During Long-Distance Trips,"David Clar-Garcia, Miguel Fabra-Rodriguez, Hector Campello-Vicente, Emilio Velasco-Sanchez",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110394,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/394/pdf?version=1761557992,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/394,,"The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (BEVs) has increased the need to understand how fast-charging strategies influence long-distance travel times under real-world conditions. While most manufacturers specify maximum charging power and standardized driving ranges, these figures often fail to reflect actual highway operation, particularly in adverse weather. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the fast-charging behaviour, net battery capacity and highway energy consumption of 62 EVs from different market segments. Charging power curves were obtained experimentally at high-power DC stations, with data recorded through both the charging infrastructure and the vehicles’ battery management systems. Tests were conducted, under optimal conditions, between 10% and 90% state of charge (SoC), with additional sessions performed under both cold and preconditioned battery conditions to show thermal effects on the batteries’ fast-charging capabilities. Real-world highway consumption values were applied to simulate 1000 km journeys at 120 km/h under cold (−10 °C, cabin heating) and mild (23 °C, no AC) weather scenarios. An optimization model was developed to minimize total trip time by adjusting the number and duration of charging stops, including a 5 min detour for each charging session. Results show that the optimal charging cutoff point consistently emerges around 59% SoC, with a typical deviation of 10, regardless of ambient temperature. Charging beyond 70% SoC is generally inefficient unless dictated by charging station availability. The optimal strategy involves increasing the number of shorter stops—typically every 2–3 h of driving—thereby reducing total trip. Full article"

Here, we establish a leakage-averse, cross-battery evaluation framework encompassing 32 commercial LIBs (B5–B56) spanning diverse cycling histories and temperatures (≈4 °C, 24 °C, 43 °C). Models ranging from classical regressors to ensemble trees and deep sequence architectures were assessed under blocked 5-fold GroupKFold splits using RMSE, MAE, R 2 with confidence intervals, and inference latency. The results reveal distinct stratification among model families. Sequence-based architectures—CNN–LSTM, GRU, and LSTM—consistently achieved the highest accuracy (mean RMSE ≈ 0.006; per-cell R 2 up to 0.996), demonstrating strong generalization across regimes. Gradient-boosted ensembles such as LightGBM and CatBoost delivered competitive mid-tier accuracy (RMSE ≈ 0.012–0.015) yet unrivaled computational efficiency (≈0.001–0.003 ms), confirming their suitability for embedded applications. Transformer-based hybrids underperformed, while approximately one-third of cells exhibited elevated errors linked to noise or regime shifts, underscoring the necessity of rigorous evaluation design. Collectively, these findings establish clear deployment guidelines: CNN–LSTM and GRU are recommended where robustness and accuracy are paramount (cloud and edge analytics), while LightGBM and CatBoost offer optimal latency–efficiency trade-offs for embedded controllers. Beyond model choice, the study highlights data curation and leakage-averse validation as critical enablers for transferable and reliable SOH estimation.

Simulation results reveal that high-SOC windows, deep cycling, and elevated temperatures significantly accelerate capacity fade, with distinct aging behavior observed between residential and utility profiles. In particular, frequency modulation and deep-cycle self-consumption use cases impose more severe aging stress compared to microgrid or medium-cycle conditions. The study provides interpretable degradation metrics and visualizations, enabling targeted aging analysis under different load conditions.

Expansion Pressure as a Probe for Mechanical Degradation in LiFePO4Prismatic Batteries,"Shuaibang Liu, Xue Li, Jinhan Li, Jintao Shi, Xingcun Fan, Zifeng Cong, Xiaolong Feng, Haoteng Li, Wenwei Wang, Jiuchun Jiang, Xiao-Guang Yang",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110391,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/391/pdf?version=1761228947,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/391,,"Battery mechanical properties degrade progressively with aging, manifesting as expansion pressure in module-constrained cells. Here, an in situ pressure operating system was developed to replicate the mechanical environment of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries, enabling long-term monitoring under different loads and temperatures. Coupled with quasi-static compression tests on internal components, stress–strain curves and elasticity moduli were obtained to link microscopic behavior with macroscopic pressure response. Results show that irreversible pressure growth is jointly governed by state of health (SOH) and load: under low-load conditions, irreversible pressure increases nonlinearly with SOH, whereas higher loads yield more linear trends. A multilevel physical model encompassing electrodes, cells, and modules was proposed to explain these behaviors. This model takes into account the influence of external pressure on the modulus of the battery, and indicates that SOH and load influence reversible pressure curves through their effect on modulus. A theoretical method was derived to calculate in-module modulus, confirming its linear correlation with the fluctuation amplitude of reversible pressure. Differential pressure-capacity analysis further demonstrated that characteristic changes in expansion pressure reflect modulus evolution, and deviations from this relationship reveal degradation pathways such as gas generation, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth, or lithium plating. This study establishes pressure signals as mechanistic indicators of modulus evolution and provides a framework for diagnosing mechanical degradation in batteries. Full article"
Propane Ignition Characteristics in a Pt-Catalyzed Microreactor for SOFC Preheating: A Numerical Study of Catalyst Activity Effects,"Zhulong Wang, Zhen Wang, Zhifang Miao, Lili Ma, Weiqiang Xu, Zunmin Li, Zhiyuan Yang, Guohe Jiang",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110390,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/390/pdf?version=1761211152,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/390,,"Leveraging catalytic microreactors as compact yet powerful thermal sources represents a promising approach to enable rapid and reliable startup of small-scale solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems. In the present study, the homogeneous–heterogeneous (HH) combustion behavior of a propane/air mixture in a Pt-catalyzed microreactor is investigated using two-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. The catalytic reaction kinetics model is integrated into the general module of ANSYSY Fluent via a user-defined function (UDF) interface. By varying the surface area factor, the ignition characteristics of the propane/air mixture under different catalyst activities are systematically explored. Numerical results reveal that the relative catalyst activity range of 0–2 represents a sensitive region for propane/air ignition characteristics, characterized by a 541 K decrease in ignition temperature and a 50% reduction in ignition delay time. Nevertheless, further increases in relative catalyst activity from 2 to 10, yield a much smaller reduction—64 K in ignition temperature and 6.7 s in ignition delay time—indicating a weakly responsive regime. The relative contribution of the heterogeneous reaction (HTR) to the total heat release decreases with higher feed temperatures but increases with enhanced catalyst activity. Regarding the temporal evolution of HTR contribution, the initiation of homogeneous ignition undermines the dominance of HTR contribution. Irrespective of catalytic activity levels, the relative contributions of the two reaction pathways subsequently undergo dynamic redistribution and ultimately stabilize, reaching an equilibrium state within approximately 10 s. These findings provide critical insights into the role of catalyst activity in propane/air mixture ignition and the interplay between homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions in microscale combustion systems.

In addition, we study repeatability across various tester-module configurations. EIS results remain highly consistent (±100 µΩ) across three different modules. Comparing the same module across two different testers, deviations are even lower (±30 µΩ up to 1 kHz). The EIS evolution is studied with respect to the cycle numbers, where a strong correlation of low-frequency impedance features is demonstrated. A new combined quotient feature is introduced and suggested as a reliable and efficient state of health (SoH) indicator, solely based on a model-free and phenomenological approach. The study demonstrates the potential of EIS as a powerful tool for battery module characterization, provided that its requirements and limitations are carefully addressed through well-defined experimental setups. Accurate and repeatable EIS measurements are particularly important for obtaining accurate electrochemical insights, especially in the low-to-mid frequency domain, where impedance variations are most sensitive to battery states and ageing effects.

Tailoring Particle Size and Morphology to Enhance Performance and Safety of Glass-Based Battery Separators,"Philipp Rank, Sebastian Müllner, Thorsten Gerdes, Christina Roth",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11110388,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/388/pdf?version=1761135685,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/11/388,,"The thermal characteristics and surface properties of battery separators are commonly modified by the incorporation of inorganic particles into a polymeric matrix material. At present, the particles employed are predominantly of an arbitrary shape. Herein, we demonstrate significantly improved battery safety features using a glass-based separator consisting of platelet-shaped particles. Glass is selected due to its temperature stability and the freedom of design that it offers when particles are formed directly from the melt. The influence of the particles’ aspect ratio and layer stacking on the electrochemical properties was analyzed, and a parametric study of glass particle layers as function of edge length and thickness was conducted. Particles with an excessively high aspect ratio impede the Li + diffusion pathway, thereby negatively affecting the performance and stability of the battery cell. Conversely, if the aspect ratio is insufficient, a deterioration in cell performance can be observed, particularly at elevated C-rates, due to the high specific surface area of the particles. Hence, the utilization of particles with a moderate aspect ratio of about 10 and a thickness of around 1 µm is proposed to ensure optimum performance. Full article"
Advancements in Vibration Testing: Effects on Thermal Performance and Degradation of Modern Batteries,"Khursheed Sabeel, Maher Al-Greer, Imran Bashir",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020082,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/82/pdf?version=1739975219,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/82,8,"Lithium-ion cells are increasingly being used as central power storage systems for modern applications, i.e., e-bikes, electric vehicles (EVs), satellites, and spacecraft, and they face significant and constant vibrations. This review examines how these vibrations affect the batteries’ mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Vibrations can cause structural issues, such as the separation of electrodes and the deformation of separators. These problems raise internal resistance and lead to localized heat generation. As a result, thermal management becomes more complicated, battery aging accelerates, and safety risks arise, including short circuits and thermal runaways. To tackle these challenges, we need more realistic testing protocols that consider the combined effects of vibrations, temperature, and mechanical stress. Improving thermal management systems (TMSs) using advanced cooling techniques and materials, e.g., phase change solutions, can help to alleviate these problems. It is also essential to design batteries with vibration-resistant materials and enhanced structural integrity to boost their durability. Moreover, vibrations play a significant role in various degradation mechanisms, including dendrite formation, self-discharge, and lithium plating, all of which can reduce battery capacity and lifespan. Our current research builds on these insights using a multiscale physics-based modeling approach to investigate how vibrations interact with thermal behavior and contribute to battery degradation. By combining computational models with experimental data, we aim to develop strategies and tools to enhance lithium-ion batteries’ safety, reliability, and longevity in challenging environments.

Engineering Hierarchical Porous Electrodes Integrated with Conformal Ultrathin Nanosheets for Achieving Rapid Kinetics in High-Power Microbatteries,"Xin Chen, Minjian Gong, Jiantao Li, Wei Yang, Xu Xu",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020081,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/81/pdf?version=1739955055,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/81,1,"With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is an increasing demand for batteries with high energy and power densities. Three-dimensional microstructures present a promising approach for achieving high areal mass loading and an expanded electrochemical reaction surface. However, their high cost and complexity have hindered their widespread adoption. In this study, hierarchical porous electrodes integrated with conformal ultrathin nanosheets were fabricated to enhance reaction kinetics. The hierarchical porous skeleton provides a continuous pathway for electron transport and electrolyte diffusion, while the amorphous vanadium oxide (α-VO x ) nanosheets offer short ion diffusion channels and a large electrochemical surface area. Additionally, the internal space of the hierarchical structure accommodates substantial growth of the α-VO x nanosheets, thereby supporting high mass loading and preserving areal capacity. The resulting hierarchical electrode structure demonstrates a high energy density of 0.49 mAh cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 and an ultrahigh power density of 410 mW cm −2 at 250 mA cm −2 . The assembled microbattery, using lithium metal as the anode, is encapsulated with a novel packaging process. This microbattery can power an electronic clock for up to 18 h on a single charge, retaining 75% of its initial capacity after 180 cycles. Full article"
A Software/Hardware Framework for Efficient and Safe Emergency Response in Post-Crash Scenarios of Battery Electric Vehicles,"Bo Zhang, Tanvir R. Tanim, David Black",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020080,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/80/pdf?version=1739779915,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/80,,"The adoption rate of battery electric vehicles (EVs) is rapidly increasing. Electric vehicles differ significantly from conventional internal combustion engine vehicles and vary widely across different manufacturers. Emergency responders (ERs) and recovery personnel may have less experience with EVs and lack timely access to critical information such as the extent of the stranded energy present, high-voltage safety hazards, and post-crash handling procedures in a user-friendly manner. This paper presents a software/hardware interactive tool named Electric Vehicle Information for Incident Response Solutions (EVIRS) to aid in the quick access to emergency response and recovery information. The current prototype of EVIRS identifies EVs using the VIN or Make, Model, and Year, and offers several useful features for ERs and recovery personnel. These features include integration and easy access to emergency response procedures tailored to an identified EV, vehicle structural schematics, the quick identification of battery pack specifications, and more. For EVs that are not severely damaged, EVIRS can perform calculations to estimate stranded energy in the EV’s battery and discharge time for various power loads using either EV dashboard information or operational data accessed through the CAN interface. Knowledge of this information may be helpful in the post-crash handling, management, and storage of an EV. The functionality and accuracy of EVIRS were demonstrated through laboratory tests using a 2021 Ford Mach-E and associated data acquisition system. The results indicated that when the remaining driving range was used as an input, EVIRS was able to estimate the pack voltage with an error of less than 3 V. Conversely, when pack voltage was used as an input, the estimated state of charge (SOC) error was less than 5% within the range of 30–90% SOC. Additionally, other features, such as retrieving emergency response guides for identified EVs and accessing lessons learned from archived incidents, have been successfully demonstrated through EVIRS for quick access. EVIRS can be a valuable tool for emergency responders and recovery personnel, both in action and during offline training, by providing crucial information related to assessing EV/battery safety risks, appropriate handling, de-energizing, transport, and storage in an integrated and user-friendly manner.

Vehicle–Grid Interaction Pricing Optimization Considering Travel Probability and Battery Degradation to Minimize Community Peak–Valley Load,"Kun Wang, Yalun Li, Chaojie Xu, Peng Guo, Zhenlin Wu, Jiuyu Du",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020079,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/79/pdf?version=1739958100,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/79,2,"Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology has been widely applied in recent years. Under the time-of-use pricing, users independently decide the charging and discharging behavior to maximize economic benefits, charging during low-price periods, discharging during high-electricity periods, and avoiding battery degradation. However, such behavior under inappropriate electricity prices can deviate from the grid’s goal of minimizing peak–valley load difference. Based on the basic electricity data of a community in Beijing and electricity vehicle (EV) random travel behavior obtained through Monte Carlo simulation, this study establishes a user optimal decision model that is influenced by battery degradation and electricity costs considering depth of discharge, charging rate, and charging energy loss. A mixed-integer linear programming algorithm with the objective of minimizing the cost of EV users is constructed to offer the participation power of V2G. By analyzing grid load fluctuations under different electricity pricing strategies, the study derives the formulation and adjustment rules for optimal electricity pricing that achieve ideal load stabilization. Under 30% V2G participation, the relative fluctuation of grid load is reduced from 31.81% to 5.19%. This study addresses the challenge of obtaining optimal electricity prices to guide users to participate in V2G to minimize the peak–valley load fluctuation. Full article"

One of their standout characteristics is the separation of electrolytes into two distinct tanks, isolating them from the electrochemical stack. This unique design allows for the separate design of energy capacity and power, offering a significantly higher level of adaptability and modularity compared to traditional technologies like lithium batteries. RFBs are also an improved technology for storing renewable energy in small or remote communities, benefiting from larger storage capacity, lower maintenance requirements, longer life, and more flexibility in scaling the battery system. However, flow batteries also have disadvantages compared to other energy storage technologies, including a lower energy density and the potential use of expensive or scarce materials. Despite these limitations, the potential benefits of flow batteries in terms of scalability, long cycle life, and cost effectiveness make them a key strategic technology for progressing to net zero. Specifically, in Australia, RFBs are good candidates for storing the increasingly large amount of energy generated from green sources such as photovoltaic panels and wind turbines. Additionally, the geographical distribution of the population around Australia makes large central energy storage economically and logistically difficult, but RFBs can offer a more locally tailored approach to overcome this. This review examines the status of RFBs and the viability of this technology for use in Australia. Full article"

There is a demand for battery management solutions that can efficiently manage the balancing of battery cells across a wide range of voltage levels. This paper proposes a new inductor-based active balancing topology that achieves balancing by transferring energy from battery cells to the battery pack. One of its main advantages over existing designs is that it can operate over a wide battery cell voltage range. Moreover, multicell balancing with a balancing current independent of the imbalance level can be achieved by adjusting the width and interval of pulses. The proposed topology can be implemented using traditional low-side gate driving integrated circuits, avoiding the need for expensive isolated power modules and high-side gate drivers. Sample balancer designs for low-voltage battery cells as well as higher-voltage cells are provided. The presented experimental results verify the operation of the proposed balancer on a lithium-ion battery pack. Full article"
Forecasting Battery Cell Production in Europe: A Risk Assessment Model,"Tim Wicke, Lukas Weymann, Christoph Neef, Jens Tübke",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020076,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/76/pdf?version=1739524726,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/76,1,"The increase in battery demand, particularly from the mobility sector, has resulted in a significant increase in the required production capacities. Europe is facing a large-scale expansion of production capacities. Currently, the battery cell demand in the region accounts for approximately 25% of global demand, while only 10% of global production capacities are located there. This has motivated the announcement of a large number of production projects of over 2 TWh by 2030, which would mean overcapacity compared to projected European cell demand. In recent years, however, many of the announced Gigafactories have been delayed or cancelled. This paper aims to develop a risk assessment model for forecasting realistic future capacities for battery cell production in Europe. The proposed model combines an evaluation of industry announcements at the project level with a Monte Carlo simulation to translate the announced production projects into a European production capacity forecast. Therefore, the likelihood of implementation for individual projects is analysed within 11 topics (company, country and maturity related) and scenarios for future European production capacities are elaborated. Model validation indicates that from 54% to 75% of the announced capacities in Europe are likely to be realised (approx. 1.2 GWh–1.7 GWh by 2030). The majority of battery production projects announced in Europe are still in the planning phase (66%) with Germany, France, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe emerging as key regions. The modelling of production capacities predicts that dependency on cell imports to Europe will be reduced compared to today. Full article"

At the same time, with the vigorous development of new energy vehicles, large-scale power batteries have huge potential for renewable energy consumption. In this context, the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) method is proposed. Electric vehicles are used as energy storage systems to provide frequency regulation services as flexible power grid resources. However, when electric vehicles are invested in large-scale frequency regulation, their own power battery durability will also be affected. Based on this problem, the pseudo-two-dimensions (P2D) model of the battery was established in this paper, and the effects of temperature, state of charge (SOC), reported power, and frequency regulation conditions on battery capacity attenuation and negative potential distribution were explored through experiments and simulations.

To compensate for the initial capacity loss, we introduced an NiCo-Li 2 Se nanocomposite to an LFP battery system to act as a competitive cathode prelithiation additive. Benefiting from its zero gas-emissions, ambient stability, high irreversible capacity, low delithiation potential, and good compatibility with carbonate-based electrolytes, the NiCo-Li 2 Se additive based on the chemical conversion reaction effectively offset the initial lithium loss. As a result, with 10 wt% addition, the initial charge capacity of the Li||LFP half-cell was improved by 34 mA h g −1 . The Gra||LFP-Li 2 Se full-cell released an initial discharge specific capacity of 159.7 mA h g −1 , which increased by 18% compared with the Gra||LFP full-cell, resulting in improved cycling stability. In addition, COMSOL Multiphysics simulation was applied to verify the function of the NiCo-Li 2 Se additive, and pouch cells were assembled to explore its potential in large-scale industrial application. This work provides a meaningful research direction for the design of a prelithiation additive for LFP cells. Full article"

This study shows a novel model for the metaheuristic–stochastic optimization (minimization of the net present cost, and NPC) of sizing and energy management for stand-alone photovoltaic (PV)–wind–diesel systems with hybrid pumped hydro storage (PHS)–battery storage systems. The model is implemented in C++ programming language. To optimize operations—thus reducing PHS losses and increasing battery lifetimes—optimal energy management can optimize the power limits of using the PHS or battery to supply or store energy. The probabilistic approach considers the variability of wind speed, irradiation, temperature, load, and diesel fuel price inflation. The variable efficiencies of the components and losses and advanced models for battery degradation are considered. This methodology was applied to Graciosa Island (Portugal), showing that, compared with the current system, the optimal system (with a much higher renewable power and a hybrid PHS–battery storage) can reduce the NPC by half, reduce life cycle emissions to 14%, expand renewable penetration to 96%, and reduce the reserve capacity shortage to zero.

It is found that carbon has been the most widely used electrode material of AMICs due to its advantages of low cost, a large specific surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity. However, the application of carbon is limited by its low specific capacity, finite kinetic performance, and few active sites. Doping heteroatoms in carbon materials is an effective strategy to adjust their microstructures and improve their electrochemical storage performance, which effectively helps to increase the pseudo-capacitance, enhance the wettability, and increase the ionic migration rate.

In addition, the novel approach of the research addresses scenarios where the ambient temperature reaches the PCM’s melting point while maintaining the initial temperature at the ideal operating point of 22 °C. The experiments employed nine 2500 mAh 18650 lithium-ion cells connected in series and subjected to constant-current discharges of 1C and 3C, with a conventional air-cooled system as the baseline and paraffin as the PCM. The results indicate that as the ambient temperature reached the PCM’s melting point, approximately 98% utilization of the PCM around the heating cell was achieved. Additionally, the PCM demonstrates noticeable advantages over the baseline by stabilizing the temperature profile and reducing the maximum temperature increase rate from over 18 °C in the baseline system to around 7 °C. Notably, under a high-load (3C) discharge rate, the PCM-based system successfully maintained battery temperatures below 42 °C, demonstrating its effectiveness under demanding operational scenarios. These findings establish a critical baseline for PCM-based BTMSs operating under elevated ambient temperatures and up to the melting point of the PCM, thereby informing future research and development of more efficient PCM-based thermal management solutions.

Evaluating the state of health (SOH) of retired batteries is crucial for secondary use. However, estimating the SOH of retired batteries is time-consuming and energy-intensive. To address the problem, this paper proposes a rapid estimation strategy based on resting voltage curves. After discharging retired batteries to the same voltage, variations in the remaining state of charge (SOC) exist among batteries with different SOHs. These SOC differences lead to distinct trends in the resting voltage curves for varying SOH batteries. Our approach analyzes health features from these resting voltage discrepancies, ultimately achieving a fast estimation of retired batteries’ SOH. Additionally, during the data collection of datasets, some batteries may form outliers due to measurement errors. This paper analyzes the impact of outlier quantity on the accuracy of regression models for SOH estimation and proposes using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify and mitigate the influence of outliers, eventually enhancing the precision of SOH estimation.

Lifecycle Evaluation of Lithium-Ion Batteries Under Fast Charging and Discharging Conditions,"Olivia Bruj, Adrian Calborean",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020065,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/65/pdf?version=1739239882,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/65,5,"By employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we performed an impedance analysis of three commercial Li-ion Panasonic NCR18650B cells in order to investigate the direct effects of their internal impedance on the operating voltage, rate capability, and efficiency and their practical capacity. We aimed to assess their performance, safety, and longevity when distinct fast charge/discharge rates were applied. By maintaining a constant fast discharge rate of 2C, we monitored the degradation speed and the influence of the C-rates on the LIBs by applying distinct charge rates, namely, 1C, 1.5C, and 2C. In order to understand how their performance correlates with usage conditions, an SoH evolution analysis, together with a Q–Q 0 total charge and energy consumption examination, was performed, taking into account that cycling monitoring is vital for ensuring their longevity and/or safety. Increasing the I charge from 1C to 1.5C reduces the battery lifetime by ~50%, while in the case of fast charge/discharge rates of 2C, the lifetime performance decrease is almost ~70% due to a capacity loss that accelerates quickly when the charge rates increase. Moreover, for the latter cell, the last discharge rate can only go up to ~80% SoH, as the battery charge rate can no longer support faster degradation. In agreement with these results, the fluctuations in the Q–Q 0 total charge become more pronounced, clearly affecting LIB efficiency. High charge rates add an additional high voltage that increases the batteries’ stress, leading to a shorter lifetime. Energy consumption data follow the same trend, in which efficiency decreases dramatically when losses appear because the internal resistance causes more and more heat to be produced during both fast charging and discharging.

Hybrid Heat Pipe-PCM-Assisted Thermal Management for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Nourouddin Sharifi, Hamidreza Shabgard, Christian Millard, Ugochukwu Etufugh",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020064,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/64/pdf?version=1738920414,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/64,4,"A hybrid cooling method for 18650 lithium-ion batteries has been investigated using both experimental and numerical approaches for electric vehicle applications. The experimental setup includes a heater section, a phase change material (PCM) reservoir, and a cooling section. The heater section simulates battery heat generation with two cylindrical aluminum housings, each sized to match an 18650 battery, two cartridge heaters, and an aluminum heat sink. An airflow channel is incorporated into the cooling section. Heat transfers sequentially from the heaters to aluminum housings, the heat sink, through three copper-water heat pipes (HPs), to/from the PCM, and finally to the cooled air in the airflow channel. This innovative design eliminates direct contact between the PCM and the batteries, unlike recent studies where the PCM has been in direct contact with the batteries. Decoupling the PCM reduces system design complexity while maintaining effective thermal management. Temperature measurements at various locations are analyzed under different heater powers, air velocities, and scenarios with and without PCM. Results show that the experimental design effectively maintains battery temperatures within acceptable limits. For a power input of 16 W, steady-state temperatures are reduced by approximately 14%, 10%, and 4% with PCM compared to without PCM for air velocities of 2 m/s, 3 m/s, and 4 m/s, respectively. A transient three-dimensional numerical model was developed in ANSYS-FLUENT to provide insights into the underlying physics. The phase change was simulated using the enthalpy-porosity approach, with computational results showing reasonable agreement with experimental data. Full article"

The expanded market requirement for mobile electronics devices and flexible electronic devices also calls for efficient energy suppliers. EES devices applying pseudocapacitive materials and generated pseudocapacitive storage are gaining increasing focus because they are capable of overcoming the capacity limitations of electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and offsetting the rate performance of batteries. The pseudocapacitive storage mechanism generally occurs on the surface or near the surface of the electrode materials, which could avoid the slow ion diffusion process. Developing materials with beneficial nanostructures and optimized phases supporting pseudocapacitive storage would efficiently improve the energy density and charging rate for EES devices, such as batteries and flexible supercapacitors. This review offers a detailed assessment of pseudocapacitance, including classification, working mechanisms, analysis methods, promotion routes and advanced applications. The future challenges facing the effective utilization of pseudocapacitive mechanisms in upcoming energy storage devices are also discussed. Full article"

Although data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in lifetime prediction, the acquisition of lifecycle data for long-life lithium batteries remains a significant challenge, limiting prediction accuracy. Additionally, the varying degradation trends under different operating conditions further hinder the generalizability of existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-feature Transfer Learning Framework (MF-TLF) for predicting battery capacity in small-sample scenarios across diverse operating conditions (different temperatures and C-rates). First, we introduce a multi-feature analysis method to extract comprehensive features that characterize battery aging. Second, we develop a transfer learning-based data-driven framework, which leverages pre-trained models trained on large datasets to achieve a strong prediction performance in data-scarce scenarios. Finally, the proposed method is validated using both experimental and open-access datasets. When trained on a small sample dataset, the predicted RMSE error consistently stays within 0.05 Ah. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of MF-TLF in achieving high prediction accuracy, even with limited data. Full article"

There are numerous issues associated with the development of these sources. One of the key aspects of renewable energy sources is their problematic controllability, namely the control of energy production over time. Renewable sources are also associated with issues of recycling, utilization in different geographical zones, environmental impact within the required area, and so on. One of the most discussed issues today, however, is the question of efficient use of the energy produced from these sources. There are several different approaches to storing renewable energy, e.g., supercapacitors, flywheels, batteries, PCMs, pumped-storage hydroelectricity, and flow batteries. In the commercial sector, however, mainly due to acquisition costs, these options are narrowed down to only one concept: storing energy using an electrochemical storage device—batteries. Nowadays, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most widespread battery type. Despite many advantages of LIB technology, the availability of materials needed for the production of these batteries and the associated costs must also be considered. Thus, this battery type is not very ideal for large-scale stationary energy storage applications. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered one of the most promising alternatives to LIBs in the field of stationary battery storage, as sodium (Na) is the most abundant alkali metal in the Earth’s crust, and the cell manufacturing process of SIBs is similar to that of LIBs. Unfortunately, considering the physical and electrochemical properties of Na, different electrode materials, electrolytes, and so on, are required. SIBs have come a long way since they were discovered. This review discusses the latest developments regarding the materials used in SIB technology. Full article"

Experimental Study on Thermal Management of 5S7P Battery Module with Immersion Cooling Under High Charging/Discharging C-Rates,"Le Duc Tai, Kunal Sandip Garud, Moo-Yeon Lee",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020059,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/59/pdf?version=1738593307,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/59,4,"In this study, the efficiency of an immersion cooling system for controlling the temperature of 5S7P battery modules at high charge and discharge C-rates was experimentally evaluated. The study was conducted in three main stages including the evaluation of different coolant oils followed by the proposition of an optimal volume flow rate (VFR) and cooling performance evaluation under high charging/discharging C-rates. In the first stage, three coolant oils, including Therminol D-12, Pitherm 150B, and BOT 2100, were compared. The Therminol D-12 achieved superior cooling performance, with the highest heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of 2171.93 W/m 2 ⋅K and the ability to maintain the maximum temperature (T max ) and temperature difference (∆T) of the battery module within the safe range. In the next stage, VFR was varied between 0.4 LPM and 1.0 LPM for the selected best coolant oil of Therminol D-12. The 0.8 LPM VFR was determined to be optimal with the highest HTC of 2445.73 W/m 2 ⋅K and an acceptable pressure drop of 12,650 Pa, ensuring a balance between cooling performance and energy consumption. Finally, the cooling performance was evaluated at high charging/discharging C-rates from 1.5C to 3.0C for the proposed best coolant oil and VFR. The immersion cooling system with Therminol D-12 and a VFR of 0.8 LPM is an effective combination to achieve the desired performance of the battery module under extreme C-rate working conditions.

One of the factors that causes the model parameters to change is battery aging, which is individually and non-uniformly experienced by the cells inside the battery pack. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes an online calibration method considering the impact of cell aging and cell inconsistency. In this method, the state-of-health (SOH) levels of the individual cells are estimated using the deep learning method, and the historical parameter loop-up table is constructed to update the state-space model. The proposed calibration framework provides enhanced accuracy for cell-by-cell SOC estimation by lightweight computing devices. The SOC estimation errors of the calibrated EKF reduce to 1.81% compared to 12.1% of the uncalibrated algorithms. Full article"

This paper focuses on the effects of ultrasonic pretreatment on the discharge of spent LIBs from the perspective of electrolyte concentration and ultrasonic power. By integrating characterizations such as pH measurement and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on the discharge of spent LIBs is evaluated. Experimental results show that sodium chloride (NaCl) solution and potassium chloride (KCl) solution have a more significant and better discharge efficiency ( DE ) under ultrasonic treatment, while organic electrolyte solutions which mainly contain formate and acetate generally show a less ideal DE . Under experimental conditions of using electrolyte discharge solutions with various electrolyte concentrations with the same ultrasonic power of 300 W, the DE generated from the experimental condition with KCl solution in 30 g/200 mL deionized water is the highest, 64.9%; under different ultrasonic powers in the same electrolyte solutions, the DE of 10 wt.% HCOONa solution is the highest at ultrasonic power of 500 W, at 4.7%. This work provides a reference for the efficient and cost-effective pretreatment of spent LIBs and the discharge mechanism in different electrolyte solutions with ultrasonic treatment is also explored to support the recycling of spent LIBs.

However, the electrification of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) has been slow due to the substantial power and battery capacity required to match the large payloads and extended operational ranges. This study addresses the research gap in battery pack design for commercial HGVs by investigating the electrical and thermal behaviour of a novel battery pack configuration using an electro-thermal model based on the equivalent circuit model (ECM). Through computationally efficient 1D modelling, this study evaluates critical factors such as cycle ageing, state of charge (SoC), and their impact on the battery’s range, initially estimated at 285 km. The findings of this study suggest that optimal cooling system parameters, including a flow rate of 18 LPM (litres per minute) and actively controlling the inlet temperature within ±7.8 °C, significantly enhance thermal performance and stability. This comprehensive electro-thermal assessment and the advanced cooling strategy set this work apart from previous studies centred on smaller EV applications. The findings provide a foundation for future research into battery thermal management system (BTMS) design and optimised charging strategies, both of which are essential for accelerating the industrial deployment of electrified HGVs.

Despite promising electrochemical performances (up to 1000 mAh g −1 in the case of conversion), these materials have poor cyclability linked primarily to hysteresis phenomena. To improve their electrochemical performance, one strategy consists of reducing the particle size. A second strategy relies on the incorporation of fluorine directly into electrode materials to limit the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI). Our study focuses on the impact of fluorination on the electrochemical performance of manganese oxide obtained by solid combustion synthesis (SCS). Two fluorinating agents were used: pure gaseous molecular fluorine F 2 and radical fluorine F • through xenon difluoride XeF 2 decomposition. The use of F 2 results in strong fluorination localized primarily at the particle surface while XeF 2 diffuses deeper into the particle, resulting in the removal of residual carbon from the synthesis by combustion. The electrochemical performance of the oxide fluorinated with XeF 2 reaches more than 750 mAh g −1 after 160 cycles, whereas that of the oxide fluorinated by F 2 barely exceeds that of the non-fluorinated oxide, less than 200 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles.

Li-Ion Mobility and Solvation Structures in Concentrated Poly(ethylene carbonate) Electrolytes: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study,"Wei Tan, Kento Kimura, Yoichi Tominaga",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020052,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/52/pdf?version=1738057033,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/52,2,"With the rapid global increase in the use of digital devices and electric vehicles, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have emerged as promising candidates for all-solid-state batteries. They are expected to resolve safety concerns and overcome the limitations of energy density and charging speed associated with traditional Li-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. However, a limited understanding of ionic conduction mechanisms remains a significant barrier to their further development and practical application. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations using the COMPASS II force field under NPT/NVT ensembles at 298 K to investigate the static and dynamic properties of poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC) electrolytes at various salt concentrations. Key analyses included the radial distribution function, solvation free energy, and mean-square displacement (MSD) of individual Li cations. Based on their MSD data, Li cations were categorized into “faster” or “slower” groups, corresponding to conductivity levels above or below the average in each model. Our findings reveal that, at higher concentrations, a smaller fraction of faster Li cations contributes disproportionately more than slower Li cations to the overall mobility, highlighting that targeted manipulation of solvation structures could enhance ion transport efficiency in highly concentrated SPEs. Additionally, changes in coordination number and solvation free energy for both faster and slower Li cations suggest the existence of three different solvation patterns as salt concentration increases. These insights provide a deeper understanding of ionic transport and solvation structures in PEC electrolytes, with potential implications for the design of more efficient all-solid-state batteries.

The pre-modification introduced iron species to the surface, promoting the specific surface area, charge-stored species, and surface functionalities, which enhanced the gravimetric capacitance. X-ray diffraction confirmed the successful loading of Fe 3 O 4 and Fe. SEM implied the wider distribution of iron-rich particulates and porous carbon via self-pyrolysis on the biochar surface modified with 1.0 M C 6 H 5 FeO 7 . Contact angle measurements demonstrated the enhanced wettability of the biochar surfaces following pre-modification, with the C 6 H 5 FeO 7 -modified samples exhibiting superior wettability compared to the other groups. The gravimetric capacitance of the supercapacitor was dramatically promoted and reached 210 F/g and 219 F/g, respectively, when modified with 1.0M C 6 H 5 FeO 7 and 1.0 M FeCl 3 at a 5 mA/g current density. Compared to the birch biochar modified with 1.0 M FeCl 3 , the 1.0 M C 6 H 5 FeO 7 had a higher current response peak and capacitive behavior in the CV analysis, demonstrated better ion diffusion capacity, and had lower charge-transfer resistance in the EIS results. But, a slight irreversible process on the electrode of the 1.0 M C 6 H 5 FeO 7 group led to a lower level of the supercapacitor capacitance retention. The results using ferric solution pre-impregnation show how iron species doping can improve capacitance behavior, providing a feasible scheme for the modification of thick biochar monolith.

Ternary PEO/PVDF-HFP-Based Polymer Electrolytes for Li-Ion Batteries,"Hoang Bao Tran Nguyen, Ling Ding, Björn Pohle, Toni Schmeida, Hoang Bao An Nguyen, Daria Mikhailova",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11020045,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/45/pdf?version=1737783862,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/2/45,8,"The impetus to study and develop polymer electrolytes for metal-ion batteries is due to their enhanced safety compared to flammable organic liquid electrolytes, promising ionic conductivity, and broad electrochemical stability window, making them to viable candidates for battery application. In the current work, we present a simple fabrication procedure and a comprehensive physico–chemical study of various PVDF-HFP-based electrolyte formulations with a sufficient addition of PEO polymer, LiTFSI conducting salt, and EMIMTFSI ionic liquid. The ionic conductivity, activation energy for ionic movement and thickness of the resulting polymer electrolyte show a non-linear dependency on the PVDF-HFP/PEO ratio. The electrolyte composition with a 0.35PEO-0.65PVDF-HFP/1LiTFSI/1EMIMTFSI mass fraction exhibits the highest ionic conductivity among the compositions, revealing 7.7 × 10 − 5 S c m − 1 at 30 °C. Electrochemical tests in half full and full Li-ion batteries with a LiFePO 4 cathode and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode also emphasized this composition as the most promising one, providing an initial capacity in full cells of 120 mAh g −1 and a capacity retention of about 75% after 50 charge/discharge cycles at a 0.1 C current rate. In the PEO/PVDF-HFP polymer blend with EMIMTFSI as a plasticizer, the amount of crystalline parts, which are detrimental to a fast ionic diffusion, is significantly reduced. Full article"
Density Modeling of Battery Electrolyte Mixtures,"Christian A. Landry, Jacob G. Bergeron, Olivier Mathieu, Kevin L. Gering, James C.

Experimental density data for basic and realistic multicomponent mixtures are scarce in the literature, and a predictive model for electrolyte solution density is not yet widely available. This work resolves to create a simple predictive method that can be used to estimate the density of these mixtures. A model that accounts for intermolecular forces in the electrolyte mixture was developed and fitted to density data available in the literature that was internally vetted for consistency. The model exhibited high accuracy for single-component electrolyte mixtures, with most predictions falling within 1% of measured values and all predictions falling within 5%. The model was further extended to more realistic, multi-solvent electrolyte mixtures that exhibited similar accuracy. In addition, a novel, accurate method for computing absolute molar and mass fractions of multi-solvent mixtures with specified volumetric concentrations (e.g., 1.2 M LiPF 6 in 1:1:1% vol. ethylene carbonate-EC/diethyl carbonate-DEC/dimethyl carbonate-DMC) is also described. The two separate approaches were combined to yield a modeling framework capable of computing molar concentrations and densities of all LIB electrolyte solutions based on LiPF 6 loaded in any combination of EC, EMC, DEC, DMC, and PC. Additional ionic salt data for NaPF 6 and LiFSI were also evaluated to illustrate the adaptability of the model to different salts and electrolytes. Once again, the model was successful, with most density predictions falling within 1% error and all falling within 5%. This work ultimately provides a simple, adaptable modeling framework for accurate prediction of electrolyte mixture densities. Full article"

Although high ceramic content improves the electrochemical stability of ceramic-rich composite separators (C-SCE), the polymeric matrix also plays a vital role. In the first generation of C-SCE separators with a PEO-based matrix, the addition of 90–95 wt% of Li 6.45 Al 0.05 La 3 Zr 1.6 Ta 0.4 O 12 (LLZO) does not make C-SCE stable for cell cycling with high-voltage (HV) cathodes. For the next iteration, the objective was to find an HV-stable polymeric matrix for C-SCEs. Herein, we report results on optimizing C-SCE separators with different ceramics and polymers which can craft the system towards better stability with NMC622-based composite cathodes. Both LLZO and Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP) were utilized as ceramic components in C-SCE separators. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PDDA-TFSI) and poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) were used as polymers in the “polymer/LiTFSI/plasticizer”-based matrix. The initial phase of the selection criteria for the separator matrix involved assessing mechanical stability and ionic conductivity. Two optimized separator formulations were then tested for their electrochemical stability with both Li metal and HV composite cathodes. The results showed that Li/NMC622 cells with LP70_PVDF_HFP and LZ70_PDDA-TFSI separators exhibited more stable cycling performance compared to those with LZ90_PEO300k-based separators. Full article"

Electrolyte filling is a critical and costly bottleneck in the cell assembly and influences the quality and safety of the cells, offering great potential for identifying process optimizations. The aim of this study is to complement existing studies by analyzing and evaluating novel technologies for electrolyte filling and thus to provide guidance for industry and science. A systematic literature and patent search led to the identification of sixteen relevant technologies. These were evaluated by a group of experts from the scientific community to identify the most promising technologies. As a result of this evaluation, five technologies emerged that were assessed as positive compared to the state of the art. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the dominating trend in electrolyte filling will be direct pressurization of the battery cells with increasing pressures.

The literature indicates that Li diffusion in the cathode material Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O 2 strongly increases during electrochemical delithiation. Such an increased Li diffusivity will be advantageous for performance if it is present already in the initial state after synthesis. In order to understand the influence of a varying initial Li content on Li diffusion, we performed Li tracer diffusion experiments on Li x CoO 2 (LCO) and Li x Ni 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 (NMC, x = 1, 0.9, 0.65) cathode materials. The measurements were performed on polycrystalline sintered bulk materials, free of additives and binders, in order to study the intrinsic properties. The variation of Li content was achieved using reactive solid-state synthesis using pressed Li 2 CO 3 , NiO, Co 3 O 4 and/or MnO 2 powders and high temperature sintering at 800 °C. XRD analyses showed that the resultant bulk samples exhibit the layered LCO or NMC phases with a low amount of cation intermixing. Moreover, the presence of additional NiO and Co 3 O 4 phases was detected in NMC with a pronounced nominal Li deficiency of x = 0.65. As a tracer source, a 6 Li tracer layer with the same chemical composition was deposited using ion beam sputtering. Secondary ion mass spectrometry in depth profile mode was used for isotopic analysis. The diffusivities followed the Arrhenius law with an activation enthalpy of about 0.8 eV and were nearly identical within error for all samples investigated in the temperature range up to 500 °C. For a diffusion mechanism based on structural Li vacancies, the results indicated that varying the Li content does not result in a change in the vacancy concentration. Consequently, the design and use of a cathode initially made of a Li-deficient material will not improve the kinetics of battery performance. The possible reasons for this unexpected result are discussed. Full article"
Temperature-Dependent FTIRS Study of Manganese Oxide Spinel Obtained by Solution Combustion Synthesis (SCS) for Supercapacitor Applications,"Taylan Karakoç, Sécou Sall, Sergey N.

The structure and composition of the final product depend on the conditions of the synthesis, in particular on the composition of metal precursors, its molar ratio to the fuel component, and the mode of heating. In the present work, the study of chemical phenomena that may occur in the SCS process has been studied for the conventional nitrate–glycine synthesis of Mn oxide, as well as for nitrate–citrate–glycine and nitrate–citrate–urea synthesis. In the case of nitrate–glycine synthesis at a 1:1 fuel-to-salt ratio, the formation of a weak complex of Mn(II) and glycine provides the conditions for an instantaneous SCS reaction upon heating, resulting in slight sintering of final oxide nanoparticles. Partial hydrolysis of the Mn precursor during slow solvent evaporation results in the formation of a mixture of oxides, namely MnO and Mn 3 O 4 . Formation of MnO is completely suppressed when ammonium citrate is added into the initial mixture. Pure Mn 2 O 3 oxide is obtained from nitrate–citrate synthesis, while the pure Mn 3 O 4 phase is obtained in the case of nitrate–citrate–glycine and nitrate–citrate–urea synthesis, due to the higher temperature generated in the presence of additional fuel. In the presence of citrate, the SCS reaction is slower, resulting in stronger sintering of the nanoparticles. The study of the electrochemical properties of synthesized oxides demonstrates that SCS with the nitrate–citrate–urea mixture provides the highest charge capacitance in 1 M NaOH: 130 F/g at 2 A/g. The impedance characterization of materials allows us to propose a tentative mechanism of degradation of electrode materials during galvanostatic cycling. Full article"

However, the inherent limitations and cost of these materials are hindering their mass production. Commercial graphite can overcome the shortcomings of silicon-based materials and partially reduce their cost. In this study, a high-performance, low-cost, and environmentally friendly composite electrode material suitable for mass production was developed through optimizing the silicon content of commercial silicon–graphite composites and introducing a small amount of graphene and carbon nanofibers. This partially overcomes the inherent limitations of silicon, enhances the interface stability of silicon-based materials and the cycle stability of batteries, and reduces the irreversible capacity loss of the initial cycle. At a silicon content of 15 wt%, the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of the battery was 65%. Reducing the silicon content in the composite electrode from 15% to 10% increased the ICE to 70% and improved the first lithiation and delithiation capacities. The battery exhibited excellent cycle stability at a current density of 0.1 A g −1 , retaining approximately 65% of its capacity after 100 cycles, good performance at various current densities (0.1–1 A g −1 ), and an excellent reversible performance.

We demonstrate the use of undoped/untreated, flexible, stand-alone, mesh-like carbon cloth (C-felt) as a potential alternative anode to commonly used graphite composite anodes (GRAs) in LIBs. The performances of commercial GRAs (9 m 2 /g) and C-felt (102 m 2 /g) were compared as anodes vs. LiFePO 4 (14.5 m 2 /g) cathodes in the full battery. Half-cell test results determined appropriate mass ratios of 2:1 for GRAs (LiFePO 4 /GRA) and 1:1 for C-felt (LiFePO 4 /C-felt). At a 0.3 C discharge rate, the 1:1 ratio yielded a specific discharge capacity of 104 mAh/g, in contrast to 87 mAh/g for the 2:1 ratio for a full cell in the 100th cycle, corresponding to a retention of 82% for the 1:1 LiFePO 4 /C-felt full cell and 70% for the 2:1 LiFePO 4 /GRA full cell from their first specific discharge capacities. By varying the ratio of C-felt anode to LiFePO 4 cathode in a full cell and expressing the specific capacity in the 100th cycle as a function of the fraction of C-felt present (at a fixed amount of LiFePO 4 ), a maximum specific capacity was achieved at a fraction of C-felt equal to 0.542 or (1:1.18) LiFePO 4 /C-felt or 106 mAh/g. This corresponds closely to the experimentally determined value and supports (1:1) LiFePO 4 /C-felt full cell as an optimum ratio that can outperform the (2:1) LiFePO 4 /GRA full cell in our test conditions. Hence, we present C-felt anode as a potential cost-effective, lightweight anode material for low-cost LIBs. Full article"

This study presents an experimental analysis of a battery thermal management system (BTMS) incorporating electromagnetic induction heating and a fluid-based heat transfer mechanism to alleviate these problems. The experimental setup utilizes a closed-loop circulation system where ethylene glycol-based fluid flows through induction-heated copper tubes, ensuring efficient heat transfer to an 18650-cell battery. This study evaluates heating performance under varying ambient temperatures (−15 °C and −5 °C), fluid flow rates (0.22, 0.3, and 0.5 L/min), and induction power levels (150 W, 225 W, 275 W, and 400 W). The results indicate that lower flow rates (e.g., 0.22 L/min) provide faster heating due to longer thermal interaction time with the battery; however, localized boiling points were observed at these low flow rates, potentially leading to efficiency losses and thermal instability. At −15 °C and 400 W, the battery temperature reached 25 °C in 383 s at 0.22 L/min, while at 0.5 L/min, the same temperature was achieved in 463 s. Higher flow rates improved temperature uniformity but slightly reduced heating efficiency due to increased heat dissipation. Internal resistance measurements revealed a substantial decrease as battery temperature increased, further validating the effectiveness of the system. These findings present a viable alternative for heating electric vehicle batteries in sub-zero environments, thereby optimizing battery performance and extending operational lifespan. Full article"
Least Cost Vehicle Charging in a Smart Neighborhood Considering Uncertainty and Battery Degradation,"Curd Schade, Parinaz Aliasghari, Ruud Egging-Bratseth, Clara Pfister",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11030104,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/3/104/pdf?version=1741684863,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/3/104,,"The electricity landscape is constantly evolving, with intermittent and distributed electricity supply causing increased variability and uncertainty. The growth in electric vehicles, and electrification on the demand side, further intensifies this issue. Managing the increasing volatility and uncertainty is of critical importance to secure and minimize costs for the energy supply. Smart neighborhoods offer a promising solution to locally manage the supply and demand of energy, which can ultimately lead to cost savings while addressing intermittency features. This study assesses the impact of different electric vehicle charging strategies on smart grid energy costs, specifically accounting for battery degradation due to cycle depths, state of charge, and uncertainties in charging demand and electricity prices. Employing a comprehensive evaluation framework, the research assesses the impacts of different charging strategies on operational costs and battery degradation. Multi-stage stochastic programming is applied to account for uncertainties in electricity prices and electric vehicle charging demand. The findings demonstrate that smart charging can significantly reduce expected energy costs, achieving a 10% cost decrease and reducing battery degradation by up to 30%. We observe that the additional cost reductions from allowing Vehicle-to-Grid supply compared to smart charging are small. Using the additional flexibility aggravates degradation, which reduces the total cost benefits. This means that most benefits are obtainable just by optimized the timing of the charging itself.

The high thermal stability and non-leakage properties of polymer electrolytes (PEs) make them attractive as next-generation electrolytes for LIBs. This study presents a blended terpolymer electrolyte (BTPE) membrane, integrating the high ionic conductivity of dual ion conducting polymer electrolytes (DICPEs) with the elevated lithium transference number ( t + t + ) of single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs). The BTPE was synthesized by blending PAA–PVA with lithiated acrylic acid (LiAA), lithiated 2–acrylamido–2–methylpropane sulfonic acid (LiAMPS), and a 2–hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)–based terpolymer, using lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) as the lithium salt. The synthesized BTPE showed excellent physical and electrochemical stability; it also exhibited an enhanced lithium transference number ( t + t + = 0.47) and high ionic conductivity (5.21 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at 30 °C), attributed to the interaction between the FSI anion and the NH group of AMPS.

This phenomenon impacts the battery’s Coulomb efficiency, cycle stability, and rate performance. In this paper, a pyrrolidinium-type di-cation ionic liquid, butyl-1,4-di(methylpyrrolidinium) di[hexafluorophosphate] (C 4 di[mPy].di[PF 6 ]), is studied as an electrolyte additive to improve the interphase stability of the HC anode. The PF 6 − in C 4 di[mPy].di[PF 6 ] enhances the coordination number between Na + and PF 6 − , and C 4 di[mPy] 2+ is preferentially reduced, jointly participating in the construction of stable, thin, dense and NaF-rich SEI films, thus laying the foundation for improving battery performance. As a result, in the carbonate electrolyte containing 2 wt% C 4 di[mPy].di[PF 6 ], the reversible capacity of the HC/Na half-cell is increased by 14.7%, and the capacity retention rate remains at 90.4% after 400 cycles.

Safety-Critical Influence of Ageing on Mechanical Properties of Lithium-Ion Pouch Cells,"Gregor Gstrein, Syed Muhammad Abbas, Eduard Ewert, Michael Wenzl, Christian Ellersdorfer",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11030099,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/3/99/pdf?version=1741316378,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/3/99,2,"While the effect of ageing has been thoroughly analysed, to improve the cycle life of lithium-ion batteries, its impact on safety in case of a mechanical loading is still a new field of research. It has to be found out how mechanical properties, such as the tolerable failure force or deformation, change over the operational lifetime of a battery. To answer this question, mechanical abuse tests were carried out with pouch cells used in recent electric vehicles in a fresh state and after usage over 160.000 km. These tests were complemented with a detailed component level analysis, in order to identify mechanisms that lead to changed cell behaviour. For the analysed aged cells, a significantly different mechanical response was observed in comparison with the respective fresh samples. The tolerable force was severely reduced (up to −27%), accompanied by a notable reduction in the allowable deformation level (up to −15%) prior to failure, making the aged cells clearly more safety critical. Based on the subsequent component tests, the predominant mechanism for this different behaviour was concluded to be particle cracking in the cathode active material. The found results are partly in contrast with the (few) other already published works. It is, however, unclear if this difference is rooted in different cell chemistries or types, or another battery state resulting from varying ageing procedures. This underlies the importance of further investigations in this research field to close the apparent gap of knowledge. Full article"

However, their practical applications are hindered by Se aggregation, sluggish ion diffusion, and significant volumetric expansion. To address these challenges, monodisperse hierarchical N-doped carbon microspheres (NCHS) with uniformly sized pores were synthesized as cathode hosts. The flower-like microstructure, formed by the assembly of two-dimensional building blocks, mitigated Se aggregation and facilitated uniform distribution within the pores, enhancing Se utilization. Nitrogen doping, introduced during synthesis, strengthened chemical bonding between selenium and the carbon host, suppressed side reactions, and accelerated reaction kinetics. These synergistic effects enabled efficient ion transport, improved electrolyte accessibility, and enhanced redox reactions. Additionally, the uniform particle and pore sizes of NCHS effectively mitigated volumetric expansion and surface accumulation, ensuring long-term cycling stability and superior electrochemical performance. Se-loaded NCHS (Se@NCHS) exhibited a high discharge capacity of 199.4 mA h g −1 at 0.5 C after 500 cycles with 70.4% capacity retention and achieved 188 mA h g −1 at 3.0 C, outperforming conventional carbon hosts such as Super P. This study highlights the significance of structural and chemical modifications in optimizing cathode materials and offers valuable insights for developing high-performance energy storage systems.

A deep understanding of the relationships between cycle capacity and the design elements of doped LiCoO 2 is critical for overcoming the existing research limitations. The key lies in constructing a robust and interpretable mapping model between data and performance. In this study, we analyze the correlations between the features and cycle capacity of 158 different element-doped LiCoO 2 systems by using five advanced machine learning algorithms. First, we conducted a feature election to reduce model overfitting through a combined approach of mechanistic analysis and Pearson correlation analysis. Second, the experimental results revealed that RF and XGBoost are the two best-performing models for data fitting. Specifically, the RF and XGBoost models have the highest fitting performance for IC and EC prediction, with R 2 values of 0.8882 and 0.8318, respectively. Experiments focusing on ion electronegativity design verified the effectiveness of the optimal combined model. We demonstrate the benefits of machine learning models in uncovering the core elements of complex doped LiCoO 2 formulation design. Furthermore, these combined models can be employed to search for materials with superior electrochemical performance and processing conditions. In the future, we aim to develop more accurate and efficient machine learning algorithms to explore the microscopic mechanisms affecting doped layered oxide cathode material design, thereby establishing new paradigms for the research of high-performance cathode materials for lithium batteries.

It is shown that the solubility of ethylene carbonate increased with pressure at both temperatures, ranging from 0.24 to 8.35 g/kg CO 2 . The retrieved solubility data were fitted using the Chrastil model, and the average equilibrium association number was determined to be 4.46 and 4.02 at 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively.

This approach allowed for a rapid assessment of several performance-influencing factors, including the number of layers in the pouch cell, cathode thickness, active material percentage, and electrolyte volume. The highest calculated energy density of small-format pouch cells was shown to be 282 Wh kg −1 and 454 Wh L −1 , achieved in a 3 Ah, 20-layer pouch cell.

This issue has become a significant barrier to the expansion of LIB technologies. Addressing the urgent need for safer LIBs, this study developed a comprehensive model to simulate TR in cylindrical 18650 nickel cobalt manganese (NMC) LIBs. By incorporating experiments with LG ® -INR18650-MJ1 cells, the model specifically aimed to accurately predict critical TR parameters, including temperature evolution, internal pressure changes, venting phases, and mass loss dynamics. The simulation closely correlated with experimental outcomes, particularly in replicating double venting mechanisms, gas generation, and the characteristics of mass loss observed during TR events. This study confirmed the feasibility of assuming proportional relationships between gas generation and the cell capacity and between the mass loss from solid particle ejection and the total mass loss, thereby simplifying the modeling of both gas generation and mass loss behaviors in LIBs under TR. Conclusively, the findings advanced the understanding of TR mechanisms in LIBs, providing a solid foundation for future research aimed at mitigating risks and promoting the safe integration of LIBs into sustainable energy solutions.

This system utilizes an AC pulse excitation signal combined with an “intelligent fast fourier transform (IFFT) optimization algorithm” to achieve rapid “one-to-many” impedance data measurements. This significantly enhances the speed, flexibility, and practicality of EIS testing. Furthermore, the conventional model-fitting approach for EIS data often struggles to resolve the issue of overlapping impedance arcs within a limited frequency range. To address this, the present study employs the Regularization Distributed Relaxation Time (RDRT) method to process EIS data obtained under AC pulse conditions.

The Z-type battery thermal management system’s (BTMS’s) structure is one of the widely investigated air-cooled TMSs. Several designs of air-cooled BTMSs are often associated with the drawback of a rise in Δ P ∆ P , consequently resulting in an increase in pumping costs. In this study, the investigation of a Step-like plenum design was extended by exploring one and two outlets to determine possible decreases in the maximum battery temperature ( T m a x T m a x ), maximum battery temperature difference ( Δ T m a x ∆ T m a x ), and pressure drop ( Δ P ∆ P ). The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was employed to predict the performances of different designs. The designs combine Step-like plenum and two outlets, with the outlets located at different points on the BTMS. The results from the study revealed that using a one-outlet design, combined with a Step-like plenum design, reduced T m a x T m a x by 3.52 K when compared with that of the original Z-type system. For another design with two outlets and the same Step-like plenum design, a reduction in T m a x T m a x by 3.45 K was achieved. For Δ T m a x ∆ T m a x , the use of a two-outlet design and a Step-like plenum design achieved a reduction of 6.34 K. Considering the Δ P ∆ P performance, the best- and poorest-performing designs with two outlets reduced Δ P ∆ P by 5.91 Pa and 3.66 Pa, respectively, when compared with that of the original Z-type design. The performances of the designs in this study clearly show the potential of two-outlet designs in reducing Δ P ∆ P in systems. This study, therefore, concludes that the operational cost of the Step-like plenum Z-type BTMS can be reduced through the careful positioning of the two-outlet section, which will promote the design and development of current and future electric vehicle (EV) technologies.

A Novel Capacity Estimation Method for Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on the Adam Algorithm,"Yingying Lian, Dongdong Qiao",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11030085,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/3/85/pdf?version=1740057409,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/3/85,,"Accurate estimation of the capacity of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for battery management and secondary utilization, which can ensure the healthy and efficient operation of the battery system. In this paper, we propose multiple machine learning algorithms to estimate the capacity using the incremental capacity (IC) curve features, including the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) model, root mean square propagation (RMSprop) model, and support vector regression (SVR) model. The Kalman filter algorithm is first used to construct the IC curve, and the peak and corresponding voltages correlated with battery life were analyzed and extracted as capacity estimation features. The three models were then used to learn the relationship between aging features and capacity. Finally, the lithium-ion battery cycle aging data were used to validate the capacity estimation performance of the three proposed machine learning models. The results show that the Adam model performs better than the other two models, balancing efficiency and accuracy in the capacity estimation of lithium-ion batteries throughout the entire lifecycle.

Heat generation in lithium-ion cells arises primarily from ohmic losses and entropy change ( Δ S ), yet the latter remains frequently overlooked in battery modelling. However, the impact of considering or discarding Δ S from electro-thermal modelling remains subject to debate. This research highlights the critical role of Δ S in improving the accuracy of electro-thermal models for lithium-ion batteries, particularly in high-fidelity thermal simulations. It presents a systematic integration, Δ S , into electro-thermal models, leveraging the energetic macroscopic representation (EMR) approach to enhance predictive accuracy, a methodology not previously structured in this manner. This paper addresses this issue by performing a comparative analysis of an electro-thermal model (ETM) with and without Δ S . The findings provide clear insights into the role of entropy in electro-thermal modelling, demonstrating that while entropy change has a minimal impact on electrical behaviour prediction, it plays a crucial role in accurately capturing temperature dynamics, helping define the conditions under which it must be considered in simulations. While entropy can be neglected for coarse heat generation estimation, its inclusion enhances temperature prediction accuracy by up to 4 °C, making it essential for applications requiring precise thermal management. This study offers a detailed analysis of the conditions under which Δ S becomes critical to model accuracy, providing actionable guidance for battery engineers and researchers. Full article"

The growing demand for LIBs, coupled with a shortage of critical battery materials, has prompted the scientific community to seek ways to improve material utilization through the recycling of end-of-life LIBs. While valuable battery metals are already being recycled on an industrial scale, graphite—a material classified as a critical resource—continues to be discarded. In this study, graphite waste recovered from the recycling of LIBs was successfully upcycled into an active graphite/rGO (reduced graphene oxide) composite oxygen electrocatalyst. The precursor graphite for rGO synthesis was also extracted from LIBs. Incorporating rGO into the graphite significantly enhanced the specific surface area and porosity of the resulting composite, facilitating effective doping with residual metals during subsequent nitrogen doping via pyrolysis. These composite catalysts enhanced both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, enabling their use as air electrode catalyst materials in zinc–air batteries (ZABs). The best-performing composite catalyst demonstrated an impressive power density of 100 mW cm −2 and exceptional cycling stability for 137 h. This research further demonstrates the utilization of waste fractions from LIB recycling to drive advancements in energy conversion technologies. Full article"

The dynamic electrochemical properties within a cell can be represented by an equivalent circuit to observe the impedance over a range of frequencies, which is an indicator of the cell’s degradation buildup from an electrical framework. This process provides information on the different electrochemical processes observed at different frequency ranges, which can be used to optimally predict the capacity fade of a cell. With the increasing demand for batteries, faster and less computationally intensive means are being explored to predict the capacity degradation of batteries. The proposed method in this article introduces an effective reduced equivalent circuit model (ER-ECM) for battery prognosis studies. The ER-ECM measures the parameters of impedance spectra from the high- to mid-frequency regions for data input. These parameters are then used to accurately predict the capacity of the battery and its state of health. The results show that the overarching charge transfer resistance provides the most salient data for capacity predictions, having an average capacity error of 1.4%, which is a 40% reduction compared to using all the parameters of the ER-ECM. The ECMs used in this study also provide faster model training and testing by 6% compared to using global impedance spectra. Full article"

This study proposes a real-time core temperature estimation framework integrating joint EKF with an electro-thermal-aging model (ECM-1D). Using only surface temperature and voltage measurements, it simultaneously estimates core temperature, SOC, and capacity with bidirectional electro-thermal coupling. The hybrid approach pre-calibrates temperature/SOC/SOH-dependent parameters offline while updating capacity online. Validation under extreme conditions (high-rate cycling, aging, and ISCs) demonstrates 60% lower core temperature RMSE during high-rate cycling, a maximum estimation error below 0.9 K, and 58.9% reduction in SOC estimation error under aging conditions versus existing methods. The framework reliably tracks core temperature trends despite parasitic heat and signal noise, enabling earlier critical temperature warnings.

However, the high cost and low selectivity of conventional catalysts hinder the large-scale integration of ZABs into the electric grid. This study presents binder-free Fe-based bifunctional electrocatalysts synthesized via a sol–gel method, followed by thermal treatment under ammonia flow. Supported on nickel foam, the catalyst exhibits enhanced activity for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), essential for ZAB operation. This work addresses two critical challenges in the development of ZABs: first, the replacement of costly cobalt or platinum-group-metal (PGM)-based catalysts with an efficient alternative; second, the achievement of prolonged battery performance under real conditions without passivation. Structural analysis confirms the integration of iron nitrides, oxides, and carbon, resulting in high conductivity and catalytic stability without relying on precious or cobalt-based metals. Electrochemical tests reveal that the catalyst calcined at 800 °C delivers superior performance, achieving a four-electron ORR mechanism and prolonged operational life compared to its 900 °C counterpart. Both catalysts outperform conventional Pt/C-RuO 2 systems in stability and selective bifunctionality, offering a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative. The innovative combination of nitrogen, carbon, and iron compounds overcomes limitations associated with traditional materials, paving the way for scalable, high-performance applications in renewable energy storage.

Biomass waste-derived porous carbon is particularly attractive as a sustainable alternative, offering environmental benefits and high-value applications with low costs. In this study, coffee grounds (CGs) were selected as a precursor due to their abundance and cost-effectiveness compared with other biomass wastes. To improve the pore characteristics of CG-derived carbon (CCG), boric acid treatment was applied during carbonization followed by steam activation to prepare boron-doped CG-derived porous carbon (B-PCG). The N 2 /77K adsorption–desorption isotherms revealed a significant increase in the specific surface area and total pore volume of B-PCG from 1590 m 2 /g and 0.71 cm 3 /g to 2060 m 2 /g and 1.01 cm 3 /g, respectively, compared with PCG. Furthermore, high pressure CO 2 adsorption analysis at 298 K up to 50 bar showed an approximately 50% improvement in CO 2 adsorption capacity for B-PCG compared with PCG.

However, their commercialisation is hindered by technical limitations and fragmented research efforts that predominantly focus on materials or individual performance parameters. This narrow scope limits SSB design and optimisation, potentially delaying the transition to commercial cells. Addressing these challenges requires a systematic framework that integrates key design and performance considerations. This study introduces a modelling framework that addresses these challenges by offering a systematic approach to SSB design. The model streamlines the design process by enabling users to define material selections and cell configurations while calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), such as energy density, power density, and resistance, as well as the specifications required for cell manufacturing. A material compatibility validation feature ensures appropriate selection of anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials, while an integrated sensitivity analysis (SA) function identifies critical design parameters for performance optimisation. The model’s accuracy and applicability were validated through comparisons with experimental data, established design frameworks, and the reverse-engineering of commercial SSB prototypes. Results show that the model predicts energy densities within a ±4% deviation in most cases. Additionally, the application of SA highlights its effectiveness in refining design parameters and optimising cell configurations. Despite certain limitations, the model remains a valuable tool in the early stages of battery concept development. It offers researchers and industry professionals a practical means to assess the feasibility of SSB designs and support future scale-up and industrialisation efforts. Full article"

While extensive research has focused on isolated gas generation mechanisms in specific components, critical knowledge gaps persist in understanding cross-component interactions and the cascading failure pathways it induced. This review systematically decouples gas generation mechanisms at cathodes (e.g., lattice oxygen-driven CO 2 /CO in high-nickel layered oxides), anodes (e.g., stress-triggered solvent reduction in silicon composites), electrolytes (solvent decomposition), and auxiliary materials (binder/separator degradation), while uniquely establishing their synergistic impacts on battery stability. Distinct from prior modular analyses, we emphasize that: (1) emerging systems exhibit fundamentally different gas evolution thermodynamics compared to conventional materials, exemplified by sulfide solid electrolytes releasing H 2 S/SO 2 via unique anionic redox pathways; (2) gas crosstalk between components creates compounding risks—retained gases induce electrolyte dry-out and ion transport barriers during cycling, while combustible gas–O 2 mixtures accelerate thermal runaway through chain reactions. This review proposes three key strategies to suppress gas generation: (1) oxygen lattice stabilization via dopant engineering, (2) solvent decomposition mitigation through tailored interphases engineering, and (3) gas-selective adaptive separator development. Furthermore, it establishes a multiscale design framework spanning atomic defect control to pack-level thermal management, providing actionable guidelines for battery engineering. By correlating early gas detection metrics with degradation patterns, the work enables predictive safety systems and standardized protocols, directly guiding the development of reliable high-energy batteries for electric vehicles and grid storage.

This material, a result of the high-energy ball-milling of a by-product of the carbothermal reduction of silica (Si slag), is predominantly made up of micrometric particles of amorphous or short-range order Si in which submicrometric SiC inclusions are dispersed. Its capacity is 860 mAh g −1 (1.7 mAh cm −2 ) after 200 cycles in half-cell configuration and 1.6 mAh cm −2 after 70 cycles in full-cell. The SiC component is not electroactive for lithiation but plays a key role in the electrode stability by preventing the formation of the c-Li 15 S i4 phase, known to accelerate electrode degradation. It is shown that capacity decay with cycling mainly originates from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth rather than particle disconnections. Complementary wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) analyses confirm the SEI grows alongside cycling and allows for the highlighting of its major components, namely, Li 2 CO 3 and LiF. The morphological evolution of the electrode upon cycling is studied by electrochemical dilatometry, operando optical microscopy, and focused ion beam (FIB) and broad ion beam (BIB) scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

A load cycle is described as the operation of an energy storage system. The cycles can include different metrics depending on the storage application. Load cycle analysis using the rainflow counting method is employed to understand and validate the metrics of the load cycles generated. Current load cycle generation can involve clustering methods, random microtrip methods, and machine learning techniques. The study includes a random microtrip method that utilises the Random Pulse Method (RPM) and enhances it to develop an improved version called the Gradient Random Pulse Method (gradRPM), which includes the control of stress factors such as the gradient of the state of charge (SOC). This method is relatively simple but, in many cases, it fulfills its purpose. Another more sophisticated method to control stress factors has been proposed, namely the Information Maximising-Recurrent Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (Info-RCGAN). It uses a deep learning algorithm to follow a machine learning-based, data-driven load cycle generation approach. Both approaches use the measurement dataset of a BMW i3 over multiple years to generate new synthetic load cycles. After generating the load cycles using both approaches, they are applied in a laboratory environment to evaluate the stress factors and validate how similar the synthetic data are to a real measurement. The results provide insights into generating simulation or testing data for electrical energy storage applications. Full article"

The non-intrusive triggering mechanism enables precise thermal runaway initiation within two seconds through localized eddy current heating (>1200 °C), validated through cell-level tests with 100% success rate across diverse trigger positions. System-level thermal propagation tests were conducted on two identical battery boxes. The parallel experiments revealed distinct propagation patterns influenced by system sealing quality. In the inadequately sealed system (Box 01), flame formation led to accelerated thermal propagation through enhanced convective and radiative heat transfer. In contrast, the well-sealed system (Box 02) maintained an oxygen-deficient environment, resulting in a controlled sequential propagation pattern. The testing methodology incorporating dummy modules proved efficient for validating thermal protection strategies while optimizing costs. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of thermal runaway propagation mechanisms and the development of standardized testing protocols for large-format battery systems. Full article"

However, the intricate and nonlinear behavior of the battery degradation process poses significant challenges in accurately predicting its cycle life at an early stage. This work addresses the battery lifetime prediction problem by leveraging machine learning (ML) methods. First, we apply quantile transformation (QT) to both features and battery cycle lives to improve their correlation. Next, we adopt a centered isotonic regression (CIR) method in our work, a variant of isotonic regression (IR) that centers the feature values and then reduces overfitting to improve model performance. Finally, we perform convex regression (CR) to capture specific patterns in the battery dataset where monotonicity is absent and achieve an overall prediction for battery cycle lives. To validate our proposed method, we have done a comprehensive comparison among several different benchmarks, including elastic net, gradient boosting regression tree, decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, and Gaussian process regression.

DIS leads to fatigue damage of the active particles during periodic cycling, causing battery aging and capacity degradation. This article establishes a two-dimensional particle-binder system model in which a linear elastic model is used for the active particle, and an elastic-viscoplastic model is used for the binder. The state of charge, stress, and strain of the particle-binder system under different charge rates are investigated. The simulation results show that the location of particle crack excitation is related to two factors: the concentration gradient of lithium-ion and the binder confinement effect. Under a lower charge rate, the crack excitation position of the particle located at the edge of the particle-binder interfacial (PBI) is mainly attributed to the binder confinement effect, while under a higher charge rate, the crack excitation position occurs at the center of the particle due to the dominance of concentration gradient effect. Furthermore, analysis reveals that the binder undergoes plastic deformation due to the traction force caused by particle expansion, which weakens the constraint on the particle and prevents PBI debonding. Finally, a binder with lower stiffness and higher yield strength behavior is recommended for rapid stress release of particles and could reduce plastic deformation of the binder. Full article"

Lead–acid batteries are a good candidate to be used in battery energy storage due to their safety, recyclability, and long cycle life; however, the correct battery, cell, and regime should be chosen to ensure effective use. Manufacturers rarely publish data on PSOC performance of their batteries. During PSOC use, the charge acceptance of lead–acid batteries reduces both reversibly and, sometimes, irreversibly as the battery is cycled. Typical dynamic charge acceptance tests target the performance required in car batteries and do not adequately demonstrate the charge acceptance expected in BESS use. This paper demonstrates a representative charge acceptance degradation test which far more closely replicates the charge acceptance degradation seen in real-world PSOC BESS use using partial state of charge, coulomb control, and a charge-factor-controlled full charge. Full charges are shown to reverse the internal resistance associated with partial-state-of-charge operation. This is the case in the Leoch lead–carbon cells and 12 V battery tested. This shows that partial-state-of-charge operation degrades the charge acceptance and increases the internal resistance of a lead–acid battery, although with a charge-factor-based full-charge approach, the charge acceptance could be reset to baseline.

Through testing at various temperatures and working conditions and a comparison with the conventional joint method, the efficacy of the algorithm presented in this study is confirmed. The findings demonstrate that the maximum root mean square error is kept at 1.57% and that the joint VFFRLS-AEKF technique suggested in this paper can effectively predict the lithium battery SOC. In contrast, the algorithm in this paper takes an average of less than 151 s to converge to within the 2% error range of the true value under various working conditions when the initial SOC value is set incorrectly. It also has good robustness and adaptability to adjust well to complex working conditions, which enhances the ability to predict energy consumption and the battery’s efficiency. Full article"
Optimizing Multi-Microgrid Operations with Battery Energy Storage and Electric Vehicle Integration: A Comparative Analysis of Strategies,"Syed Muhammad Ahsan, Petr Musilek",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11040129,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/4/129/pdf?version=1743039692,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/4/129,5,"This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of the operational strategies for multi-microgrid systems that integrate battery energy storage systems and electric vehicles. The analyzed strategies include individual operation, community-based operation, a cooperative game-theoretic method, and the alternating direction method of multipliers for multi-microgrid systems. The operation of multi-microgrid systems that incorporate electric vehicles presents challenges related to coordination, privacy, and fairness. Mathematical models for each strategy are developed and evaluated using annual simulations with real-world data. Individual operation offers simplicity but incurs higher costs due to the absence of power sharing among microgrids and limited optimization of battery usage. However, individual optimization reduces the multi-microgrid system cost by 47.5% when compared to the base case with no solar PV or BESS and without optimization. Community-based operation enables power sharing, reducing the net cost of the multi-microgrid system by approximately 7%, as compared to individual operation, but requires full data transparency, raising privacy concerns. Game theory ensures fair benefit allocation, allowing some microgrids to achieve cost reductions of up to 13% through enhanced cooperation and shared use of energy storage assets. The alternating direction method of multipliers achieves a reduction in the electricity costs of each microgrid by 6–7%. It balances privacy and performance without extensive data sharing while effectively utilizing energy storage. The findings highlight the trade-offs between cost efficiency, fairness, privacy, and computational efficiency, offering insights into optimizing multi-microgrid operations that incorporate advanced energy storage solutions.

To move towards the fabrication of such high-performance membranes, the creation of hydrophilic ion-conducting double gyroid (DG) nanochannels within block copolymer (BCP) AEMs is a promising approach. However, this attractive solution remains difficult to implement due to the complexity of constructing a well-developed ion-conducting DG morphology across the entire membrane thickness. To deal with this issue, water permeable polystyrene- block -poly(2-vinylpyridine)- block -poly(ethylene oxide) membranes with ion-conducting DG nanochannels were produced by combining a solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment with a methylation process. Here, the SVA treatment enabled the manufacture of DG-forming BCP AEMs while the methylation process allowed for the conversion of pyridine sites to N -methylpyridinium (NMP + ) cations via a Menshutkin reaction. Following this SVA-methylation method, the IC value of water-permeable (~384 L h −1 m −2 bar −1 ) DG-structured BCP AEMs in their OH − counter anion form was measured to be of ~2.8 mS.cm −1 at 20 °C while a lower IC value was probed, under the same experimental conditions, from as-cast NMP + -containing analogs with a non-permeable disordered phase (~1.2 mS.cm −1 ).

The proposed system structure consists of an MMC with four full-bridge modules per phase, where one module acts as a spinning reserve during normal operation. The algorithm addresses a single switch fault per phase by operating the faulted module in half-bridge mode, ensuring all batteries remain operational and maintaining full power output and battery capacity without any noticeable changes for the vehicle operator. Unlike conventional fault-tolerant strategies that often reduce power output or disable affected modules, the proposed algorithm isolates the faulty switch while preserving system output. This approach avoids derating and eliminates the need for immediate maintenance, enabling the EV to continue operating under fault conditions. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the algorithm under a single switch fault scenario, demonstrating its ability to maintain autonomy and consistent power delivery. This work demonstrates a fault-tolerant MMC principle, offering a robust and scalable solution for enhancing reliability and user satisfaction in EV power systems. Full article"

Do Silicon-Based Li-Ion Batteries Require a Time-Consuming Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Process?,Sheng S.

Traditionally, SEI formation requires a low current rate (0.05C–0.1C) and a moderate temperature (25–45 °C), and the same process has been widely applied in the manufacturing of silicon-based Li-ion batteries. However, silicon stores Li + ions through different mechanisms than graphite, raising the question of whether such a time-consuming SEI formation process is necessary. In this work, carbon-coated SiO x is selected as a representative silicon material, and both Li/SiO x half-cells and SiO x /LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) full cells are assembled and cycled at varying current rates for the first 10 cycles, followed by identical cycling conditions for the subsequent cycles. The results show that the initial current rate has a minimal impact on the long-term cycling stability of both SiO x -based Li metal half-cells and Li-ion cells. Notably, Li-ion cells formed at higher current rates exhibit lower overall impedance than those formed at lower current rates, consequently demonstrating better rate capability. These findings suggest that the time-consuming SEI formation process may not be necessary for the manufacturing of silicon-based Li-ion batteries, potentially simplifying production and reducing processing time.

Both pristine wafers and laser-ablated wafers were assessed, where the silicon anodes were paired with all-active material LiCoO 2 cathodes to assess the system as lithium-ion full cells. The laser ablation process modified the surface morphology of the silicon wafers, creating a polycrystalline silicon layer with increased surface area. Electrochemical cycling revealed that the laser-treated wafers demonstrated higher capacity retention and improved rate capability compared to untreated wafers, especially when discharged at the highest current density of 7 mA cm −2 .

While traditional LIBs rely on organic electrolytes, these flammable solutions pose safety risks and require expensive, moisture-sensitive manufacturing processes. Aqueous electrolytes offer a safer, more cost-effective alternative, but their narrow electrochemical window, corrosivity to electrodes, and enabling of dendritic growth on metal anodes limit their practical applications. Water-in-salt electrolytes (WiSEs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. By significantly reducing water activity and forming a stable solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI), WiSEs can expand the electrochemical stability window, inhibit material dissolution, and suppress dendritic growth. This unique SEI formation mechanism, which is similar to that observed in organic electrolytes, contributes to the improved performance and stability of WiSE-based batteries. Additionally, the altered solvation structure of WiSEs minimizes the presence of free water molecules, further stabilizing the SEI and reducing water activity. This review comprehensively examines the composition, mechanisms, and characterization of WiSEs and their application in monovalent-metal-ion batteries. Full article"

Subjecting a battery to extreme conditions of charging and discharging can negatively impact its performance and reduce its cycle life. Assessing a battery’s electrical and thermal behaviour is critical in the later stages of developing battery management systems (BMSs). The present study aims at the thermal modelling of a 3.3 Ah cylindrical 26650 lithium iron phosphate cell using ANSYS 2024 R1 software. The modelling phase involves iterating two geometries of the cell design to evaluate the cell’s surface temperature. The multi-scale multi-domain solution method, coupled with the equivalent circuit model (ECM) solver, is used to determine the temperature characteristics of the cell. Area-weighted average values of the temperature are obtained using a homogeneous and isotropic assembly. A differential equation is implemented to estimate the temperature due to the electrochemical reactions and potential differences. During the discharge tests, the cell is subjected to a load current emulating the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). The results from the finite element model indicate strikingly similar trends in temperature variations to the ones obtained from the experimental tests. Full article"

However, the long-term Na + (de)intercalating process destroys the structure of the two-phase interface between the electrode and electrolyte, impairing cycling stability. In this paper, a few-layer graphene (FLG)-coated hard carbon fiber composite is constructed. A uniform graphene encapsulation is confirmed by synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy technologies. Post-cycling observation reveals FLG participation in forming a hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). At a proper concentration, the FLG with a small specific surface area and pore size characteristics is well matched in the SEI. The FLG-integrated SEI not only mitigates volume expansion but also enhances ion conductivity through its oxygen-rich functional groups. As a result, the composite structure maintains 98.2% capacity retention after 100 cycles and reaches 164 mAh g −1 at 1000 mA g −1 , compared to 97 mAh g −1 for the pristine hard carbon.

Investigating the thermal runaway characteristics is essential for battery safety design. In this study, the thermal runaway characteristics of 18650 lithium-ion batteries under different SOCs were systematically analyzed by experiment and simulation. It was found that at high SOC (100%), the highly lithium state accelerated lattice oxygen release, promoted the formation of LiNiO and intensified electrolytic liquid oxygenation combustion, while at low SOC (20%), the reduction environment dominated, and the metal Ni and residual graphite were significantly enriched. Gas analysis shows that CO 2 and H 2 account for more than 80%, and their proportion is regulated by SOC. Temperature and pressure monitoring showed that the increase in SOC significantly increased the thermal runaway peak temperature (100% SOC up to 508.4 °C) and pressure (0.531 MPa).The simulation results show that when the battery pack is out of control, the ejection fire and explosion pressure wave are concentrated in the middle and upper region (overpressure up to 0.8 MPa). This study reveals the mechanism by which SOC affects the path of product and gas generation by regulating the oxidation/reduction balance, which lays a theoretical and simulation foundation for the safe design of batteries and the quantitative evaluation of thermal runaway.

The PVA–carbon composite creates an external short-circuit pathway of moderate resistance that enables the complete discharge of batteries. Abusive testing conducted after deactivation demonstrates that hazards are largely eliminated, including a complete avoidance of thermal runaway from lithium-ion cells and a reduction in flammable and toxic gases by several orders of magnitude.

However, current lithium-plating detection methods predominantly rely on complex hardware systems with insufficient sensitivity, presenting significant challenges for implementation in increasingly prevalent Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) scenarios. This study proposes a novel bidirectional pulse-current charging method designed to mitigate lithium plating and retard battery aging through intermittent pulse-current application. Experimental results verify a 30–50% reduction in capacity fade rate under fast charging conditions (≥0.5 C rates). Furthermore, by leveraging pulse-current characteristics, we reveal strong correlations between the evolution patterns of charge/discharge internal resistance and lithium plating. An in situ detection criterion requiring no additional hardware is established: the L-shaped decline of charging internal resistance under high-rate conditions coupled with the disappearance of defined reverse-hump curves in discharge resistance profiles serve as precise indicators of lithium-plating onset. Validation through SEM and relaxation voltage differential analysis confirms 100% detection accuracy. This methodology combines rapid detection capability, non-destructive nature, and compatibility with V2G applications, providing new perspectives for enhancing lithium-ion battery longevity and lithium-plating detection.

Fast-Charging Optimization Method for Lithium-Ion Battery Packs Based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm,"Zhi Zhang, Taijun Guo, Yefeng Liu, Xinfu Pang, Zedong Zheng",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11050199,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/5/199/pdf?version=1747474216,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/5/199,2,"Fast-charging technology for lithium-ion batteries is of great significance in reducing charging time and enhancing user experience. However, during fast charging, the imbalance among battery cells can affect the overall performance and available capacity of the battery pack. Moreover, the charging efficiency not only is limited by the battery technology itself but is also closely related to the optimization of the charging strategy. To address the optimization of fast charging for lithium-ion batteries, this paper proposes a method based on deep reinforcement learning. First, a deep reinforcement learning charging optimization model is constructed, aiming to minimize charging time and SOC balancing cost, with constraints on battery voltage, temperature, SOC, and SOH. The model employs the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm integrated with reward centralization and entropy regularization mechanisms, aiming to dynamically adjust the charging current to achieve an optimal balance between fast charging and battery health. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method enhances charging efficiency, contributes to extending battery life, and supports the safety of the charging process. Compared to the traditional constant-current constant-voltage (CCCV) strategy, the improved DDPG strategy reduces the total charging time by 60 s and the balancing time from 540 s to 470 s. Furthermore, compared to the basic DDPG method, the proposed algorithm shows a clear advantage in charging efficiency. Full article"
A Thermal Runaway Protection Strategy for Prismatic Lithium-Ion Battery Modules Based on Phase Change and Thermal Decomposition of Sodium Acetate Trihydrate,"Tianqi Yang, Hanwei Xu, Chengfu Xie, Linzhi Xu, Min Liu, Lingyu Chen, Qianqian Xin, Juan Zeng, Hengyun Zhang, Jinsheng Xiao",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11050198,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/5/198/pdf?version=1747733877,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/5/198,1,"With the rapid development of battery energy storage technology, the issue of thermal runaway (TR) in lithium-ion batteries has become a key challenge restricting their safe application. This study presents an innovative protection strategy that integrates liquid cooling with sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT)-based composite phase change materials (CPCM) to mitigate TR and its propagation in prismatic battery modules. Through numerical simulation, this study systematically investigates the TR protection mechanism and optimization pathways for prismatic battery modules. The results indicate that pure SAT exhibits poor latent heat performance due to its low thermal conductivity. In contrast, the incorporation of expanded graphite (EG) significantly enhances thermal conductivity and improves the overall latent heat performance. Compared to traditional paraffin-expanded graphite (PA-EG), SAT-EG, with a latent heat 4.8 times higher than that of PA-EG, demonstrates more than six times the effectiveness in delaying thermal runaway propagation (TRP). When combined with liquid cooling, the TR protection effect is further enhanced, and TR will not be triggered when the initial abnormal heat generation rate is relatively low. Even if an abnormal battery experiences TR, its propagation will be prevented when the thickness of the SAT-EG exceeds 12 mm. Ambient temperature influences both the peak temperature and the timing of its occurrence in the battery module. Among the different liquid cooling layouts, the combined bottom and side cooling scheme exhibits superior performance compared to the standalone schemes. Full article"

In this study, 5 Ah nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) pouch cells were subjected to external heating; overcharge at rates of 2.5, 5 and 10 A; and nail penetration. Tests were conducted in air and N 2 atmospheres. Additional external heat tests were performed on cells at 5, 25, 50, and 75% SoC and on two, three, and four cell blocks. Gas volumes were calculated, and the gas composition was given for H 2 , CO, CO 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , CH 4 , C 3 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 . For tests under an air atmosphere at 100% SoC, the volume of gas varied between abuse methods: 3.9 L (external heat), 6.4 L (overcharge), and 8.9 L (nail penetration). The gas composition was found to predominantly contain H 2 , CO 2 , and CO for all abuse methods; however, higher concentrations of H 2 and CO were present in tests performed under N 2 .

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely implemented due to their high safety and energy density. Although LIBs exhibit enhanced safety features, significant fire risks persist during thermal runaway (TR) events occurring in charging/discharging processes. To elucidate dual-parallel jelly-roll architecture TR characteristics of LIBs under varied operational conditions, this study integrates theoretical analysis with experimental methods, conducting thermal abuse tests under four distinct working conditions: open circuit, constant-current charging, constant-voltage charging, and discharging. The results demonstrate substantial differences in TR characteristics across operational conditions. A thermodynamic equilibrium-based triggering model proved capable of qualitatively evaluating TR risk levels under these conditions. Furthermore, the established TR triggering model reveals that the intensified Joule heating and polarization effects during constant-current charging account for its elevated fire risk compared to other states. These findings provide operational guidelines for optimizing safety strategies in energy storage power stations. Full article"

Laser cutting, as a contactless process, is possible under a defined drying room atmosphere. However, it is a costly process and therefore not suitable for industrial usage. Consequently, the development of a cost-effective process gas is imperative for the future implementation of lithium metal. In this research, the laser cutting of 30 µm lithium copper composite foil is performed under different process gases (nitrogen and argon) and ambient atmospheres with different water contents to determine the ablation potential depended on the process gas. To assess the laser–material interaction, the impact of pulse repetition frequency and cutting velocity on the material behavior was investigated. To this end, the ablation behavior, the resulting cutting edges, and the electrochemical performance were thoroughly explored. The findings reveal a dependence of the ablation behavior on the water content in the ambient atmosphere, as well as a reduced energy input for a complete shot through when using an inert gas. The resulting cutting edges result in nearly similar outcomes with regard to the heat-affected zone. The electrochemical performance illustrates the influence of the laser process with different gases, taking into account the changed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Full article"

However, diverse aging mechanisms, changing working conditions and cell-to-cell variation lead to the inhomogeneous cell lifespan and complicated life prediction. In this work, a data-driven algorithm based on stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) encoder–decoders is proposed for RUL prediction. The encoder and upstream decoder form an autoencoder framework for feature extraction. The encoder and the downstream decoder form the encoder–decoder framework for RUL prediction. To enhance generalization during training, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss is included in the autoencoder framework. The similarity of aging patterns is analyzed during splitting source and target datasets through k-means and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). The Euclidean metric with accumulated Equivalent Cycle Number (ECN) sequence during aging shows better performance for similarity-based data splitting than the Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) distance metric based on capacity fading trajectory.

To facilitate and speed up the architectural development, the laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) process was applied as a digital additive manufacturing method. As polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), the binder commonly used in the LIFT process, is not a suitable binder for silicon-containing electrodes due to its weak binding forces, polyacrylic acid (PAA) was introduced as a binder for use in printable electrode pastes. Since water as a solvent in such pastes evaporates quickly and the corresponding printing time would be too short, glycerol was added to the solvent mixture in different amounts. The silicon in the printed electrodes reaches a specific capacity of more than 3000 mAh ⋅ g – 1 · g – 1 for most of the printed anodes. To further improve the electrochemical performance of the printed electrodes, as well as the rheology of the slurries, two different conductive additives with different particle sizes were used.

However, its widespread adoption in embedded systems is currently limited by the need to balance measurement accuracy with strict energy constraints and the requirement for short acquisition times. This work proposes a novel broadband EIS approach based on a multiband multisine excitation strategy in which the excitation signal spectrum is divided into multiple sub-bands that are sequentially explored. This enables the available energy to be concentrated on a limited portion of the spectrum at a time, thereby significantly improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without substantially increasing the total measurement time. The result is a more energy-efficient method that maintains high diagnostic precision. We further investigated the optimal design of these multiband multisine sequences, taking into account realistic constraints imposed by the sensing hardware such as limitations in excitation amplitude and noise level. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated within a comprehensive simulation framework implementing a complete impedance measurement system. Compared with conventional excitation techniques (i.e., the sine sweep and the classical single-band multisine methods), the proposed strategy is an optimal trade-off solution both in terms of energy efficiency and measurement time. Therefore, the technique is a valuable solution for real-time, embedded, and in situ battery diagnostics, with direct implications for the development of intelligent battery management systems (BMS), predictive maintenance, and enhanced safety in energy storage applications.

However, achieving precise SOH prediction under small-sample conditions remains a significant challenge due to inherent variability among battery cells and capacity recovery phenomena, which result in irregular degradation patterns and hinder effective feature extraction. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an advanced autoencoder-based method specifically designed for SOH prediction in small-sample scenarios. This method employs a multi-encoder structure—comprising token, positional, and temporal encoders—to comprehensively capture the multi-dimensional characteristics of SOH sequences. Furthermore, a BHTP module is integrated to facilitate feature fusion and enhance the model’s stability and interpretability. By utilizing a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, the proposed method effectively reduces computational complexity and the number of model parameters while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The validation of the NASA 18650 lithium cobalt oxide battery dataset under various discharge strategies shows that the proposed method achieves fast convergence and outperforms traditional prediction methods. Compared with other models, our method reduces the RMSE by 0.004 and the MAE by 0.003 on average. In addition, ablation experiments show that the addition of the multi-encoder structure and the BHTP module improves the RMSE and MAE by 0.008 and 0.007 on average, respectively. These results highlight the robustness and utility of the proposed method in real battery management systems, especially under data-scarce conditions. Full article"

Electrochemical–Thermal Modeling of Lithium-Ion Batteries: An Analysis of Thermal Runaway with Observation on Aging Effects,"Milad Tulabi, Roberto Bubbico",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11050178,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/5/178/pdf?version=1746155432,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/5/178,6,"The increasing demand for energy storage solutions, particularly in electric vehicles and renewable energy systems, has intensified research on lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery safety and performance. A critical challenge is thermal runaway (TR), a highly exothermic sequence of reactions triggered by mechanical, electrical, or thermal abuse, which can lead to catastrophic failures. While most TR models focus on fresh cells, aging significantly impacts battery behavior and safety. This study develops an electrochemical–thermal coupled model that incorporates aging effects to better predict thermal behavior and TR initiation in cylindrical Li-ion batteries. The model is validated against experimental data for fresh NMC and aged NCA cells, and statistical analysis is conducted to identify key factors influencing TR ( p < 0.05). A full factorial design evaluates the effects of internal resistance (10, 20, 30, and 40 mΩ), capacity (1, 2, 3, and 5 Ah), and current rate (1C, 3C, 6C, and 8C) on temperature evolution. Additionally, a machine learning algorithm (logistic regression) is employed to identify an internal resistance threshold, beyond which thermal runaway (TR) becomes highly probable, and to predict TR probability based on key battery parameters. The model achieved a high prediction accuracy of 95% on the test dataset. Results indicate that aging affects thermal stability in complex ways. The increased internal resistance exacerbates heating rates, while capacity fade reduces stored energy, mitigating TR risk. These findings provide a validated framework for enhancing battery thermal management and predictive safety mechanisms, which contributed to the development of safer, more reliable Li-ion energy storage systems.

In commercial ZEBRA batteries, Ni electrode and beta’’-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) have a more than 70% share of the overall cell material costs. Na-ZnCl 2 all-liquid batteries (ALBs), which replace Ni with abundant and low-cost Zn and BASE electrolyte with molten salt electrolyte, could reduce costs and provide a longer lifetime and higher safety, making their application in grid storage promising. However, compared to SEBs, ALBs are in an early development stage, particularly for their molten salt electrolytes, which have a significant effect on the battery performance. Physical and chemical properties of the salt electrolyte like melting temperatures and solubilities of electrode materials (i.e., Na and Zn metal) are vital for the molten salt electrolyte selection and battery cell design and optimization. In this work, the binary and ternary phase diagrams of salt mixtures containing NaCl, CaCl 2 , BaCl 2 , SrCl 2 , and KCl, obtained via FactSage simulation and DSC measurements, as well as the solubilities of electrode materials (Na and Zn metals), are presented and used for the selection of the molten salt electrolyte. Moreover, various criteria, considered for the selection of the molten salt electrolyte, include high electromotive force (EMF) for suitable electrochemical properties, low melting temperature for large charge/discharge range, low solubilities of electrode materials for low self-discharge, low material costs, and high material abundance for easy scale-up. Based on these criteria, the NaCl-CaCl 2 -BaCl 2 and NaCl-SrCl 2 -KCl salt mixtures are selected as the two most promising ALB molten salt electrolytes and suggested to be tested in the ALB demonstrators currently under development.

This paper proposes a deep learning model dimension-wise convolutions-globalfilter networks (DimConv-GFNet) for lithium-ion battery SOH estimation. Particularly, the DimConv-GFNet comprises the dimension-wise convolutions (DimConv), which collect the multi-scale local features from different sensor signals, and lightweight global filter networks (GFNet) to capture long-range dependencies in the Fourier frequency domain. Unlike Transformer attention architectures, GFNet utilizes spectral properties to facilitate global information exchange with a lower computational complexity. Experiments on two datasets with a total of 167 commercial LFP/graphite cells validate the effectiveness of DimConv-GFNet. Although the model shows slightly lower accuracy compared to the DimConv-Transformer baseline, it delivers competitive performance with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.335%, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.233% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.230%. Remarkably, the DimConv-GFNet substantially reduces computational demands, requiring fewer than one-third of the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameters of DimConv-Transformer. These results demonstrate DimConv-GFNet strikes a good balance between accuracy and efficiency, positioning it as a promising solution for efficient and accurate SOH estimation in battery management applications.

The primary side of all BFCs is in parallel with the battery pack, and the secondary side is connected to the individual cells. Such an input-parallel output-series structure allows for bidirectional and controllable energy transfer among the cells. The control of the charging/discharging for a specific cell can be realized by adjusting the PWM signal on the primary or secondary side of the corresponding BFC. Based on this, three cell balancing strategies are proposed: maximum voltage discharge (MXVD), minimum voltage charge (MNVC), and maximum and minimum voltage balancing (MX&MNB). For MX&MNB, which is essentially a combination of MXVD and MNVC, it controls the maximum voltage cell discharging and minimum voltage cell charging simultaneously, where the energy is transferred directly between the two cells with the largest voltage difference. A cell balancing prototype is built and tested to verify the feasibility and stability of the proposed strategy. All three proposed methods can implement cell balancing simply and effectively, while the MX&MNB provides a faster speed. Full article"

The results revealed that the fuel cell node voltage increases as the hydrogen and air excess coefficient increases, and the impact of the hydrogen and air excess coefficient on the fuel cell node voltage gradually increases as the current density increases. However, a higher hydrogen and air excess coefficient is not always better. The node voltage increases as the intake pressure increases. However, it is not that a higher intake pressure is always better, but rather that there is an optimal intake pressure value to achieve the best overall performance of the fuel cell. The node voltage increases as the coolant inlet temperature increases at most fuel cell current densities. However, the optimum fuel cell operating inlet temperature is not necessarily higher, as the coolant inlet temperature may have a strong coupling relationship with other operating conditions that will also affect the fuel cell performance. The fuel cell operating inlet temperature may have a strong coupling relationship with the intake relative humidity, and both of these parameters must be well-matched to achieve better fuel cell performance.

First, considering the variability in battery operating conditions, the study designs a battery working voltage threshold that accounts for safety margins and proposes an available energy state assessment metric, which enhances prediction consistency under different discharge conditions. Subsequently, 12 features are selected from both direct observation and statistical characteristics to capture the operating condition information of the battery, and a dataset is constructed using actual operational data from an energy storage station. Finally, the model is trained and validated on the feature dataset. The validation results show that the model achieves an average absolute error of 2.39%, indicating that it effectively captures the energy variation characteristics within the 0.2 C to 0.6 C dynamic current range. Furthermore, the contribution of each feature is analyzed based on the model’s interpretability, and the model is optimized by utilizing high-contribution features. This optimization improves both the accuracy and runtime efficiency of the model. Finally, a dynamic prediction is conducted for a discharge cycle, comparing the predictions of the IGANN model with those of three other machine learning methods. The IGANN model demonstrates the best performance, with the average absolute error consistently controlled within 3%, proving the model’s accuracy and robustness under complex conditions.

State of Charge Estimation for Sodium-Ion Batteries Based on LSTM Network and Unscented Kalman Filter,"Xiangang Zuo, Xiaoheng Fu, Xu Han, Meng Sun, Yuqian Fan",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11070274,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/274/pdf?version=1752845910,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/274,2,"With the increasing application of sodium-ion batteries in energy storage systems, accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation plays a vital role in ensuring both available battery capacity and operational safety. Traditional Kalman-filter-based methods often suffer from limited model expressiveness or oversimplified physical assumptions, making it difficult to balance accuracy and robustness under complex operating conditions, which may lead to unreliable estimation results. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid framework that combines an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for SOC estimation. Under various driving conditions, the UKF—based on a second-order equivalent circuit model with online parameter identification—provides physically interpretable estimates, while LSTM effectively captures complex temporal dependencies. Experimental results under CLTC, NEDC, and WLTC cycles demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-UKF approach reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) by an average of 2% and the root mean square error (RMSE) by an average of 3% compared to standalone methods. The proposed framework exhibits excellent adaptability across different scenarios, offering a precise, stable, and robust solution for SOC estimation in sodium-ion batteries. Full article"
Comparing the SEI Formation on Copper and Amorphous Carbon: A Study with Combined Operando Methods,"Michael Stich, Christian Leppin, Falk Thorsten Krauss, Jesus Eduardo Valdes Landa, Isabel Pantenburg, Bernhard Roling, Andreas Bund",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11070273,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/273/pdf?version=1752824331,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/273,,"The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has been studied thoroughly due to its crucial importance to the battery’s long-term performance. At the same time, most studies of the SEI apply ex situ characterization methods, which may introduce artifacts or misinterpretations as they do not investigate the SEI in its unaltered state immersed in liquid battery electrolyte. Thus, in this work, we focus on using the non-destructive combination of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D) and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the same electrochemical cell. EQCM-D can not only probe the solidified products of the SEI but also allows for the monitoring of viscoelastic layers and viscosity changes of the electrolyte at the interphase during the SEI formation. EIS complements those results by providing electrochemical properties of the formed interphase. Our results highlight substantial differences in the physical and electrochemical properties between the SEI formed on copper and on amorphous carbon and show how formation parameters and the additive vinylene carbonate (VC) influence their growth. The EQCM-D results show consistently that much thicker SEIs are formed on carbon substrates in comparison to copper substrates. Full article"

Traditional SOC estimation methods, such as Coulomb counting and open-circuit voltage measurement, suffer from cumulative errors and slow response times. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach for SOC estimation by integrating Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) with the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, Atom Search Optimization (ASO), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). This study focuses on large-capacity lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries (3.2 V, 104 Ah), addressing a gap in existing research. EIS data collected at various SOC levels and temperatures were processed using SHAP for feature extraction (FE), and the ASO–LightGBM model was employed for SOC prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SHAP–ASO–LightGBM method significantly improves estimation accuracy, achieving an RMSE of 3.3%, MAE of 1.86%, and R 2 of 0.99, outperforming traditional methods like LSTM and DNN.

Failure Analysis of Fire in Lithium-Ion Battery-Powered Heating Insoles: Case Study,"Rong Yuan, Sylvia Jin, Glen Stevick",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11070271,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/271/pdf?version=1753240802,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/271,,"This study investigates a lithium-ion battery failure in heating insoles that ignited during normal walking while powered off. Through comprehensive material characterization, electrical testing, thermal analysis, and mechanical gait simulation, we systematically excluded electrical or thermal abuse as failure causes. X-ray/CT imaging localized the ignition source to the lateral heel edge of the pouch cell, correlating precisely with peak mechanical stress identified through gait analysis. Remarkably, the cyclic load was less than 10% of the single crush load threshold specified in safety standards. Key findings reveal multiple contributing factors as follows: the uncoated polyethylene separator’s inability to prevent stress-induced internal short circuits, the circuit design’s lack of battery health monitoring functionality that permitted undetected degradation, and the hazardous placement inside clothing that exacerbated burn injuries. These findings necessitate a multi-level safety framework for lithium-ion battery products, encompassing enhanced cell design to prevent internal short circuit, improved circuit protection with health monitoring capabilities, optimized product integration to mitigate mechanical and environmental impact, and effective post-failure containment measures. This case study exposes a critical need for product-specific safety standards that address the unique demands of wearable lithium-ion batteries, where existing certification requirements fail to prevent real-use failure scenarios.

Tetramethylene sulfone (TMS), serving as a novel electrolyte additive, effectively enhances the stability of electrolytes under high-voltage conditions due to its high flash point and high dielectric constant, thereby boosting the output performance of lithium-ion batteries. In this work, we selected lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6 ) as the lithium salt, using a solvent carrier consisting of a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC). TMS was added as an additive to create a novel high-power electrolyte system. We prepared five electrolytes with different TMS concentrations and conducted in-depth investigations into their impacts on the performance of lithium-ion batteries. The findings indicate that the electrolytes with TMS ratios of 2 wt% and 5 wt% demonstrated good synergistic cathode–anode stability in the NCM//soft carbon system, and the electrolyte with a 5 wt% TMS ratio demonstrated the most significant improvement in the overall performance of the full battery.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as the cornerstone of modern portable electronics, electric vehicles, and grid-scale storage systems, are continually evolving to meet the growing performance requirements. In this dynamic context, two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as highly promising candidates for use in electrodes due to their layered structure, tunable electronic properties, and high theoretical capacity. Among 2D materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) has gained increasing attention as a promising low-dimensional candidate for LIB anode applications. This review provides a comprehensive yet concise overview of recent advances in the application of MoS 2 in LIB electrodes, with particular attention to its unique electrochemical behavior at the nanoscale. We critically examine the interplay between structural features, charge-storage mechanisms, and performance metrics—chiefly the specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. Furthermore, we discuss current challenges, primarily poor intrinsic conductivity and volume fluctuations, and highlight innovative strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations, such as through nanostructuring, composite formation, and surface engineering.

Surface Fluorination for the Stabilization in Air of Garnet-Type Oxide Solid Electrolyte for Lithium Ion Battery,"Michael Herraiz, Saida Moumen, Kevin Lemoine, Laurent Jouffret, Katia Guérin, Elodie Petit, Nathalie Gaillard, Laure Bertry, Reka Toth, Thierry Le Mercier, Valérie Buissette, Marc Dubois",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11070268,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/268/pdf?version=1753164802,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/7/268,,"After reviewing the state of the art of the fluorination of inorganic solid electrolytes, an application of gas/solid fluorination is given and how it can be processed. Garnet-type oxide has been chosen. These oxides with an ideal structure of chemical formula A 3 B 2 (XO 4 ) 3 are mainly known for their magnetic and dielectric properties. Certain garnets may have a high enough Li + ionic conductivity to be used as solid electrolyte of lithium ion battery. The surface of LLZO may be changed in contact with the moisture and CO 2 present in the atmosphere that results in a change of the conductivity at the interface of the solid. LiOH and/or lithium carbonate are formed at the surface of the garnet particles. In order to allow for handling and storage under normal conditions of this solid electrolyte, surface fluorination was performed using elemental fluorine. When controlled using mild conditions (temperature lower or equal to 200 °C, either in static or dynamic mode), the addition of fluorine atoms to LLZO with Li 6,4 Al 0,2 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 composition is limited to the surface, forming a covering layer of lithium fluoride LiF. The effect of the fluorination was evidenced by IR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopies. If present in the pristine LLZO powder, then the carbonate groups disappear. More interestingly, contrary to the pristine LLZO, the contents of these groups are drastically reduced even after storage in air up to 45 days when the powder is covered with the LiF layer. Surface fluorination could be applied to other solid electrolytes that are air sensitive. Full article"

Cells of the following formats, 26,650, pouch, and prismatic, and capacities ranging from 3 to 230 Ah, were subjected to external heat, overcharge, and nail penetration tests. Gas volume was calculated, and the following gases analysed: H 2 , CO 2 , CO, CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 . Cells that failed via external heating under inert conditions (N 2 or Ar atmosphere) at 100% state of charge (SoC) typically generated 0.7 L/Ah of gas; overcharged cells, 0.11–0.68 L/Ah; and nail penetration between 0.3 and 0.5 L/Ah. In general, for all test configurations, regardless of atmosphere, the total gas volume contained a 40% concentration of H 2 , 15% of CO 2 , and the remaining gas consisted of varying concentrations of CO and flammable hydrocarbons. This demonstrates that despite differences in gas volume, the failure gas composition of LFP cells remains similar. Full article"
Interfacial Layer (“Interlayer”) Addition to Improve Active Material Utilisation in Lithium–Sulfur Batteries: Use of a Phenylsulfonated MWCNT Film,"Luke D. J. Barter, Steven J. Hinder, John F.

Phenylsulfonate functionalisation of commercial MWCNTs was achieved via diazotisation to attach lithium phenylsulfonate groups and was characterised by IR and XPS spectroscopies. SEM-EDX showed sulfur and oxygen colocations due to the sulfonate groups on the interlayer surface. However, CHNS elemental microstudies showed a low degree of functionalisation. Without an interlayer, the LSB produced stable cycling at a capacity of 600 mA h g −1 sulfur at 0.05 C for 40 cycles. Using an unfunctionalised interlayer as a control gave a capacity of 1400 mA h g −1 sulfur for the first cycle but rapidly decayed to the same 600 mA h g −1 sulfur at the 40th cycle at 0.05 C, suggesting a high degree of polysulfide shuttling. Adding a lithium phenylsulfonated interlayer gave an initial capacity increase to 1100 mA h g −1 sulfur that lowered to 800 mA h g −1 sulfur at 0.05 C by the 40th cycle, showing an increase in charge storage (33%) relative to the other cells. This performance increase has been attributed to lessened polysulfide shuttling due to repulsion by the phenylsulfonate groups, increased conductivity at the separator-cathode interface and an increase in surface area.

Adaptive and accurate estimation of battery capacity is paramount for battery operation, maintenance, and residual value evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel battery capacity estimation method based on an approximate open circuit voltage curve. The proposed method is rigorously tested using both lithium–iron–phosphate (LFP) and nickel–cobalt–manganese (NCM) battery packs at multiple charging rates under varied aging conditions. To further enhance capacity estimation accuracy, a voltage correction strategy is implemented utilizing the incremental capacity (IC) curve. This strategy also verifies the potential benefits of increasing the charging rate to shorten the overall test duration. Eventually, the capacity estimation error is consistently controlled within 2%. With optimal state of charge (SOC) interval selection, the estimation error can be further reduced to 1%. Clearly, our proposed method exhibits excellent compatibility across diverse battery materials and degradation states. This adaptability holds substantial scientific value and practical importance.

This study presents a comprehensive machine learning framework that integrates both electrical cycling data and experimentally derived material and structural features to forecast the degradation behavior of commercial supercapacitors. A total of seven supercapacitor samples were tested under various current and voltage conditions, resulting in over 70,000 charge–discharge cycles across three case studies. In addition to electrical measurements, detailed physical and material characterizations were performed, including electrode dimension analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Three machine learning models, Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), were trained using both cycler-only and combined cycler + material features. Results show that incorporating material features consistently improved prediction accuracy across all models. The MLP model exhibited the highest performance, achieving an R 2 of 0.976 on the training set and 0.941 on unseen data. Feature importance analysis confirmed that material descriptors such as porosity, thermal stability, and electrode thickness significantly contributed to model performance. This study demonstrates that combining electrical and material data offers a more holistic and physically informed approach to supercapacitor health prediction.

This research investigates the electromechanical performance of aged 18650 lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from LEVs under mechanical impact conditions. For this study, a battery module from a used e-scooter was disassembled, and its constituent cells were reconfigured into compact modules for testing. To characterize their initial condition, the cells underwent cycling tests to evaluate their state of health (SOH). Although a slight majority of the cells retained an SOH greater than 80%, a notable increase in their internal resistance (IR) was also observed, indicating degradation due to aging. The mechanical impact tests were conducted in adherence to the UL 2271:2018 standard, employing a semi-sinusoidal acceleration pulse. During these tests, linear kinematics were analyzed using videogrammetry, while key electrical and thermal parameters were monitored. Additionally, strain gauges were installed on the central cells to measure stress and deformation. The results from the mechanical shock tests revealed characteristic acceleration and velocity patterns. These findings clarify the electromechanical behavior of aged LIBs under impact, providing critical data to enhance the safety and reliability of these vehicles. Full article"

Herein, the influences and mechanisms of high-altitude and low-pressure environment (50 kPa) on the cycling performance of commercial pouch LIBs were systematically studied. The results showed that low air pressure caused a sharp decrease in battery capacity to 46.6% after 200 cycles, with a significant increase in charge transfer impedance by 70%, and the contribution rate of active lithium loss reached 74%. Low air pressure led to irreversible deformation of the battery, resulting in the expansion of the gap between the electrodes, poor electrolyte infiltration, and reduction of the effective lithium insertion area, which in turn induced multiple synergistic accelerated decay mechanisms, including obstructed lithium-ion transmission, reduced interfacial reaction efficiency, increased active lithium consumption, changes in heat generation structure, and a significant increase in heat generation. After applying external force, the deformation of the electrode was effectively suppressed, and the cycle capacity retention rate increased to 87.6%, which significantly alleviated the performance degradation of LIBs in low pressure environment. This work provides a key theoretical basis and engineering solutions for the design of power batteries in high-altitude areas. Full article"

The proposed model integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer with a fully connected layer, leveraging their combined strengths to achieve precise RC predictions. A distinguishing feature of this study is its ability to deliver highly accurate estimates using a limited dataset that was derived from a single cylindrical LFP battery with a 40 Ah capacity and collected during a controlled experimental campaign. Despite the constraints imposed by the dataset size, the ANN demonstrates remarkable performance, underscoring the model’s capability to operate effectively with minimal data. The dataset is partitioned into the training and testing subsets to ensure a rigorous evaluation. Additionally, the robustness of the approach is validated by testing the trained ANN on data from a second battery cell subjected to a distinct aging process, which was entirely unseen during training. This critical aspect underscores the method’s applicability in estimating RC for batteries with varying aging profiles, a key requirement for real-world deployment. The proposed LSTM-based architecture was also benchmarked against a GRU-based model, yielding significantly lower prediction errors. Furthermore, beyond LFP chemistry, the method was tested on a broader NMC dataset comprising seven cells aged under different C-rates and temperatures, where it maintained high accuracy, confirming its scalability and robustness across chemistries and usage conditions. These results advance battery management systems by offering a robust, efficient modeling framework that optimizes battery utilization across diverse applications, even under data-constrained conditions.

A critical issue is their substantial performance degradation under low-humidity conditions. To address this, researchers commonly add silica to components. This study employs a control variable method to systematically investigate the impact of four parameters—gas stoichiometry, temperature, humidity, and silica content—on fuel cell performance. Initially, the effects of gas stoichiometry, temperature, and humidity on performance were examined. Subsequently, hydrophilic silica was incorporated into the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to assess its potential for improving performance in low-humidity environments. Experimental results reveal that under 100% humidification, silica addition had a minimal impact on performance, particularly at high temperatures where performance improved by only 2.5%. This is attributed to increased water production at elevated temperatures, which—when combined with silica’s water retention properties—exacerbates flooding. However, when humidity was reduced to 50%, silica incorporation significantly enhanced performance. At high temperatures, silica addition resulted in a 126.2% performance improvement, demonstrating its efficacy as a rational strategy under low-humidity conditions. Full article"

An analytical estimation of inductive characteristics is conducted to establish a foundation for system optimization. The study framework focuses on coil geometrical parameters and relative placements, accounting for horizontal, vertical, and angular misalignments to ensure a consistent performance under varying coupling conditions. COMSOL simulations accurately determine inductive parameters, validating the theoretical analysis for a 200 W charging coil prototype.

The substantial heat generation during high C-rate charging poses a significant risk of thermal runaway, necessitating advanced thermal management strategies. This study systematically investigates the coupling mechanism between charging rates and ambient temperatures in overcharge-induced thermal runaway, filling the knowledge gaps associated with multi-indicator thermal management approaches. Through experiments on prismatic LFP cells across five operational conditions (1C/35 °C, 1.5C/5 °C, 1.5C/15 °C, 1.5C/25 °C, and 1.5C/35 °C), synchronized infrared thermography and electrochemical monitoring quantitatively characterize the thermal–electric coupling dynamics throughout overcharge-to-runaway transitions. The experimental findings reveal three key observations: (1) Charge rate and temperature have synergistic amplification effects on triggering thermal runaway. (2) Contrary to intuition, while low-current/high-temperature charging enhances safety versus high-current/high-temperature conditions, low-temperature/high-current charging triggers thermal runaway faster than high-temperature/high-current scenarios. (3) Staged multi-indicator lithium battery thermal runaway warning signals would be more accurate (first peaks > 0.5 °C/s temperature rise rate + >10 V/s voltage drop rate). These findings collectively demonstrate the imperative for next-generation battery management systems integrating real-time ambient temperature compensation with adaptive C-rate control, fundamentally advancing beyond conventional single-variable thermal regulation strategies.

However, despite using a small fraction (≤5%) of Si, it suffers from a short cycle life owing to intrinsic swelling and particle pulverization during cycling, making practical application challenging. High-nickel (Ni ≥ 80%) oxide cathodes for high-energy-density LIBs and their operation beyond 4.2 V have been pursued, which requires the anodic stability of the electrolyte. Herein, we report a nonflammable multi-functional fluorinated ester–based liquid electrolyte that stabilizes the interfaces and suppresses the swelling of highly loaded 5 wt% SiO–graphite anode and LiNi 0.88 Co 0.08 Mn 0.04 O 2 cathode simultaneously in a 3.5 mAh cm −2 full cell, and improves cycle life and battery safety. Surface characterization results reveal that the interfacial stabilization of both the anode and cathode by a robust and uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, enriched with fluorinated ester-derived inorganics, enables 80% capacity retention of the full cell after 250 cycles, even under aggressive conditions of 4.35 V, 1 C and 45 °C.

These morphologies can lead to battery failure due to the formation of short circuits and significant volumetric expansion at the anode. One strategy to control the electrodeposition of Li metal is to use lithiophilic materials at the anode. Here, we evaluate the impact of Ag and Au on the early stages of Li metal electrodeposition and cycling. The alloying substrates decrease the voltage for Li reduction and improve Li wetting/adhesion. We probe volumetric expansion directly through dilatometry measurements and find that the degree of volumetric expansion is less when lithium is cycled on an alloying substrate compared to a non-alloying substrate (Cu). Dilatometry experiments reveal that Au has the least amount of volumetric expansion and coin cell cycling experiments indicate that Ag yields more stable cycling compared to Au or Cu. The evaluation of in situ cross-sectional images of cycled coin cells shows that Ag has the lowest volumetric expansion in a coin cell format. Full article"

This study addresses this critical issue by proposing a diffusion-based data augmentation methodology tailored explicitly for battery fault diagnosis scenarios. The proposed conditional diffusion model leverages transfer learning and attention-enhanced fine-tuning strategies to generate high-quality synthetic fault data, ensuring targeted representation of rare fault conditions. By integrating condition-aware sampling strategies, the approach effectively mitigates mode collapse issues frequently encountered in adversarial generative methods, thus substantially enriching the diversity and quality of fault representations. Comprehensive evaluation using statistical similarity measures and downstream classification tasks demonstrates notable improvements. After the integration of attention mechanisms, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the synthetic and real samples increases from 0.29 to 0.91. In downstream diagnostic tasks, models trained on augmented datasets exhibit substantial gains in regards to the recall and F1-score, which increase from near-zero levels to values exceeding 0.91 for subtle overcharge and overdischarge faults.

The results indicate that when hydrogen leakage flows towards the rear of the vehicle, it mainly flows along the rear wall of the space and diffuses to the surrounding areas. Setting ventilation openings of different areas on the top of the carriage did not significantly improve the spatial diffusion speed of the leaked hydrogen, and the impact on the concentration of leaked hydrogen was limited to the vicinity of the ventilation openings. The ventilation opening at the rear can accelerate the diffusion of hydrogen gas to the external environment, significantly reducing the concentration of hydrogen and rate of gas rise. When the leaked hydrogen gas flows towards the front of the vehicle and above the space, the concentration of hydrogen mainly increases along the height direction of the space. The research results have significant safety implications for the use of fuel cell semi-trailer trucks. Full article"

It also encourages the use of renewable energies to benefit from available sources. Thereby, the implementation of a photovoltaic (PV) system with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) can create a standalone MG. This paper presents an MG that uses photovoltaic energy as a principal source. An HESS is required, combining batteries and supercapacitors. This MG responds “insure” both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) loads. The batteries and supercapacitors have separate parallel connections to the DC bus through bidirectional converters. The DC loads are directly connected to the DC bus where the AC loads use a DC-AC inverter. A control strategy is implemented to manage the fluctuation of solar irradiation and the load variation. This strategy was implemented with a new logic control based on Boolean analysis. The logic analysis was implemented for analyzing binary data by using Boolean functions (‘0’ or ‘1’). The methodology presented in this paper reduces the stress and the faults of analyzing a flowchart and does not require a large concentration. It is used in this paper in order to simplify the control of the EMS. It permits the flowchart to be translated to a real application. This analysis is based on logic functions: “Or” corresponds to the addition and “And” corresponds to the multiplication. The simulation tests were executed at T au =  6 s of the low-pass filter and conducted in 60 s. The DC bus voltage was 400 V.

To meet thermal control requirements for experimental scenarios, a feedback-controlled thermal management system was developed. Computational fluid dynamics was employed to analyze the effects of seawater flow rate, seawater temperature, electrolyte flow rate, and initial electrolyte temperature on electrolyte outlet temperature and heat dissipation capacity. Results indicate that heat dissipation capacity is negatively correlated with seawater temperature and positively correlated with electrolyte inlet temperature. It increases with higher seawater and electrolyte flow rates, though the increase becomes negligible when the seawater flow rate exceeds 10 m/s.

A Framework for Anomaly Cell Detection in Energy Storage Systems Based on Daily Operating Voltage and Capacity Increment Curves,"Wanchen Liu, Zhihao Zhang, Zekai Zhao, Wenjie Zhang",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11080316,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/8/316/pdf?version=1755691722,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/8/316,,"This paper proposes a novel unsupervised multi-model fusion framework for robust cell-level anomaly detection in grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Addressing the complex nonlinearity and prevalent data quality issues (e.g., asynchronous sensors, sampling anomalies) in historical operational data, the framework synergistically integrates three complementary techniques: isolation forests for efficient feature screening and dimensionality reduction; LSTM autoencoders to capture the long-term temporal dependencies in normal behavior; and a functional principal component analysis–Mahalanobis distance (FPCA-MD) for statistically rigorous anomaly validation. The fully automated workflow pioneers the combined application of feature screening, temporal modeling, and functional data validation for cell-level diagnostics. Key contributions include (1) maintaining a high detection accuracy despite asynchronous or faulty sensor data; (2) leveraging multi-dimensional operational features beyond traditional voltage curves, optimizing the utilization of historical data through tight integration of the battery characteristics with anomaly signatures; and (3) achieving enhanced performance and robustness via the complementary fusion of diverse algorithms. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness in accurately identifying cells exhibiting various anomaly patterns (e.g., noise interference, performance degradation, cluster outliers) while significantly reducing the leakage and misdetection rates inherent in single-algorithm approaches, as validated by the probability scores from the fusion output.

However, the actual energy efficiency of metal–air batteries is much lower than the theoretical value due to the effect of polarization voltage during battery operation, limiting the power output and thus hindering their practical application. This review systematically dissects the origins of polarization: slow oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics, interfacial resistance, and mass transfer bottlenecks. We highlight cutting-edge strategies to mitigate polarization, including atomic-level engineering of air cathodes (e.g., single-atom catalysts, low Pt catalysts), biomass-derived 3D porous electrodes, and electrolyte innovations (additives to inhibit corrosion, solid-state electrolytes to improve stability). In addition, breakthroughs in metal–H 2 O 2 battery design using concentrated liquid oxygen sources are discussed.

These results indicate that the cell utilizing a higher-energy-density LMR cathode presents significantly lower thermal runaway risks and hazards. The results of differential scanning calorimetry–thermogravimetry–mass spectrometry (DSC-TG-MS) and in situ heating X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicate that the LMR cathode has superior thermal stability compared with the Ni-rich cathode, with cathode oxygen released at higher temperatures and lower rates, which is beneficial for delaying and mitigating the exothermic reaction inside the battery.

In this study, carbon-coated and Cu-substituted Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 (NVCP) composites were synthesized via a solid-state reaction using agarose as a carbon source. Structural and morphological analyses confirmed the successful incorporation of Cu 2+ ions into the rhombohedral lattice without disrupting the crystal structure and the formation of uniform conductive carbon layers.

Consequently, NVCP exhibited excellent long-term cycling performance, maintaining over 99% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, the electrode demonstrated outstanding high-rate capabilities, with a capacity recovery of 97.98% after cycling at 20 C and returning to lower current densities.

However, a major challenge hindering their widespread deployment is the formation and growth of lithium dendrites, which compromise both performance and safety. This review provides a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in dendrite suppression strategies, with special emphasis on the role played by the nature of the solid electrolyte. In particular, we examine suppression mechanisms and material innovations within the three main classes of solid electrolytes: sulfide-based, oxide-based, and polymer-based systems. Each electrolyte class presents distinct advantages and challenges in relation to dendrite behavior. Sulfide electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity and good interfacial wettability, suffer from poor mechanical strength and chemical instability. Oxide electrolytes exhibit excellent electrochemical stability and mechanical rigidity but often face high interfacial resistance. Polymer electrolytes, while mechanically flexible and easy to process, generally have lower ionic conductivity and limited thermal stability. This review discusses how these intrinsic properties influence dendrite nucleation and propagation, including the role of interfacial stress, grain boundaries, void formation, and electrochemical heterogeneity. To mitigate dendrite formation, we explore a variety of strategies including interfacial engineering (e.g., the use of artificial interlayers, surface coatings, and chemical additives), mechanical reinforcement (e.g., incorporation of nanostructured or gradient architectures, pressure modulation, and self-healing materials), and modifications of the solid electrolyte and electrode structure. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of advanced characterization techniques—such as in situ electron microscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)—for elucidating dendrite formation mechanisms and evaluating the effectiveness of suppression strategies in real time. By integrating recent experimental and theoretical insights across multiple disciplines, this review identifies key limitations in current approaches and outlines emerging research directions. These include the design of multifunctional interphases, hybrid electrolytes, and real-time diagnostic tools aimed at enabling the development of reliable, scalable, and dendrite-free SSLBs suitable for practical applications in next-generation energy storage.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a self-supervised learning framework for SOH estimation. The framework employs a dual-time-scale collaborative pre-training approach via masked voltage sequence reconstruction and interval capacity prediction tasks, enabling automatic extraction of cross-time-scale aging features from unlabeled data. Innovatively, it integrates domain knowledge into the attention mechanism and incorporates time-varying factors into positional encoding, significantly enhancing the capability to extract battery aging features. The proposed method is validated on two datasets. For the standard dataset, using only 10% labeled data, it achieves an average RMSE of 0.491% for NCA battery estimation and 0.804% for transfer estimation between NCA and NCM. For the shallow-cycle dataset, it achieves an average RMSE of 1.300% with only 2% labeled data. By synergistically leveraging massive unlabeled data and extremely sparse labeled samples (2–10% labeling rate), this framework reduces the labeling burden for battery health monitoring by 90–98%, offering an industrial-grade solution with near-zero labeling dependency.

In the extrusion-based mixing process, the first kneading concentration is one of the key processing parameters for systematic optimization of relevant electrode paste properties like viscosity and particle size distribution. For different active materials at a constant electrode paste composition, a clear correlation of increasing kneading concentration with decreasing viscosity can be observed up to a certain reversal point, initiating a change in the trend and the rheological behavior, thus indicating a process limit. The fundamental effects causing this change and the associated impact on materials and battery performance were evaluated by applying further analytical methods and electrochemical characterization. It is revealed that the change in viscosity is associated with enhanced de-agglomeration of the carbon black additive and with partial particle grinding of the active material and thus a partial change in the interlayer distance of graphene layers and, correspondingly, the electrochemical behavior of the active material. Beyond this, correlations between processing parameters and product properties are presented. Furthermore, indicators are suggested with which monitoring of the machine parameters enables the detection of changes in the electrode paste characteristics. Full article"

However, irreversible Na plating/stripping and dendritic growth remain critical barriers. Herein, we demonstrate that separator engineering is a pivotal strategy for stabilizing AFSMBs. Through systematic evaluation of four separators—2500 separator (PP), 2325 separator (PP/PE/PP), glass fiber (GF), and an Al 2 O 3 -coated PE membrane, we reveal that the Al 2 O 3 -coated separator uniquely enables exceptional interfacial kinetics and morphological control. Na||Na symmetric cells with Al 2 O 3 coated separator exhibit ultralow polarization (4.5 mV) and the highest exchange current density (1.77 × 10 −2 mA cm −2 ), while the anode-free AlC-NFPP full cells retain 91.6% capacity after 150 cycles at 2C. Specifically, the Al 2 O 3 coating homogenizes Na + flux, promotes dense and planar Na deposition, and facilitates near-complete stripping with minimal “dead Na”. This work establishes ceramic-functionalized separators as essential enablers of practical high-energy AFSMBs. Full article"
A State-of-Charge-Frequency Control Strategy for Grid-Forming Battery Energy Storage Systems in Black Start,"Yunuo Yuan, Yongheng Yang",2025,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries11080296,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/8/296/pdf?version=1754295648,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/11/8/296,,"As the penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources continues to increase, ensuring reliable power system and frequency stability is of importance. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have emerged as an important solution to mitigate these challenges by providing essential grid support services. In this context, a state-of-charge (SOC)-frequency control strategy for grid-forming BESSs is proposed to enhance their role in stabilizing grid frequency and improving overall system performance. In the system, the DC-link capacitor is regulated to maintain the angular frequency through a matching control scheme, emulating the characteristics of the rotor dynamics of a synchronous generator (SG). Thereby, the active power control is implemented in the control of the DC/DC converter to further regulate the grid frequency. More specifically, the relationship between the active power and the frequency is established through the SOC of the battery. In addition, owing to the inevitable presence of differential operators in the control loop, a high-gain observer (HGO) is employed, and the corresponding parameter design of the proposed method is elaborated. The proposed strategy simultaneously achieves frequency regulation and implicit energy management by autonomously balancing power output with available battery capacity, demonstrating a novel dual benefit for sustainable grid operation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, a 0.5-Hz frequency change and a 10% power change are carried out through simulations and also on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform.

This study proposes an integrated decision-making framework based on the T-Spherical Fuzzy Einstein Interaction Aggregator DEMATEL-CoCoSo approach to comprehensively evaluate and rank battery recycling technologies under uncertainty. Ten key evaluation criteria—encompassing environmental, economic, and technological dimensions—were identified through expert consultation and literature synthesis. The T-Spherical Fuzzy DEMATEL method was first applied to analyze the causal interdependencies among criteria and determine their relative weights, revealing that environmental drivers such as energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation exert the most systemic influence. Subsequently, six recycling alternatives were assessed and ranked using the CoCoSo method enhanced by Einstein-based aggregation, which captured the complex interactions present in the experts’ evaluations and assessments. Results indicate that Direct Recycling is the most favorable option, followed by the Hydrometallurgical and Bioleaching methods, while Pyrometallurgical Recycling ranked lowest due to its high energy demands and environmental burden. The proposed hybrid model effectively handles linguistic uncertainty, expert variability, and interdependent evaluation structures, offering a robust decision-support tool for sustainable technology selection in the circular battery economy. The framework is adaptable to other domains requiring structured expert-based evaluations under fuzzy environments. Full article"

This study presents a deep learning framework that integrates autoencoder-based anomaly detection with a residual neural network (ResNet) to achieve state-of-the-art prediction of remaining useful life at the cycle level using only a single-cycle input. The framework systematically filters out anomalous samples using multiple variants of convolutional and sequence-to-sequence autoencoders, thereby enhancing data integrity before optimizing and training the ResNet-based models.

This study investigates the influence of pulse duration on the cutting-edge characteristics and electrochemical behavior of laser-cut 20 µm lithium metal on 10 µm copper foils using nanosecond and picosecond laser systems. It was demonstrated that shorter pulse durations significantly reduce the heat-affected zone (HAZ), resulting in improved cutting quality. Electrochemical tests in symmetric Li|Li cells revealed that laser-cut electrodes exhibit enhanced cycling stability compared with mechanically separated anodes, despite the presence of localized dead lithium “reservoirs”.

Nevertheless, the uncontrolled growth of zinc dendrites and side reactions pose significant obstacles to the practical application of ZIBs. To address these issues, a straightforward strategy has been proposed, involving the addition of a minute quantity of AgNO 3 to the electrolyte to stabilize zinc anodes. This additive spontaneously forms a hierarchically porous Ag interphase on the zinc anodes, which is characterized by its zinc-affinitive nature. The interphase offers abundant zinc nucleation sites and accommodation space, leading to uniform zinc plating/stripping and enhanced kinetics of zinc deposition/dissolution. Moreover, the chemically inert Ag interphase effectively curtails side reactions by isolating water molecules. Consequently, the incorporation of AgNO 3 enables zinc anodes to undergo cycling for extended periods, such as over 4000 h at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm 2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh/cm 2 , and for 450 h at 2 mA/cm 2 with a capacity of 2 mAh/cm 2 . Full zinc-ion cells equipped with this additive not only demonstrate increased specific capacities but also exhibit significantly improved cycle stability.

While numerous studies have addressed the estimation of State of Health (SOH) and the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) using machine and deep learning, most existing models fail to capture both short-term degradation trends and long-range contextual dependencies jointly. In this study, we introduce V2G-HealthNet, a novel hybrid deep learning framework that uniquely combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Transformer-based attention mechanisms to model battery degradation under dynamic vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scenarios. Unlike prior approaches that treat SOH estimation in isolation, our method directly links health prediction to operational decisions by enabling SOH-informed adaptive load scheduling and predictive maintenance across EV fleets. Trained on over 3400 proxy charge-discharge cycles derived from 1 million telemetry samples, V2G-HealthNet achieved state-of-the-art performance (SOH RMSE: 0.015, MAE: 0.012, R 2 : 0.97), outperforming leading baselines including XGBoost and Random Forest. For RUL prediction, the model maintained an MAE of 0.42 cycles over a five-cycle horizon. Importantly, deployment simulations revealed that V2G-HealthNet triggered maintenance alerts at least three cycles ahead of critical degradation thresholds and redistributed high-load tasks away from ageing batteries—capabilities not demonstrated in previous works. These findings establish V2G-HealthNet as a deployable, health-aware control layer for smart city electrification strategies. Full article"

The framework distinguishes reversible and irreversible plating fractions, quantifies energy losses, and identifies a critical activation energy (0.25 eV) associated with surface-limited deposition. Visualizations in the form of severity maps and voltage-zone risk classifications enable direct application to battery management systems. This approach bridges electrochemical degradation modeling with real-time charge protocol design, offering a practical tool for safe, high-performance battery operation. Full article"

Although the influences from substitutions on structure and gaseous phase storage properties were minor, influences on electrochemical discharge capacity were significant. The first cycle capacity ranged from 16 mAh·g −1 (Si-substituted) to 247 mAh·g −1 (Mo-substituted). Severe alloy passivation in 30% KOH electrolyte was observed, and an original capacity close to 500 mAh·g −1 could possibly be achieved by Mo-substituted alloy if a non-corrosive electrolyte was employed. Surface coating of Nafion to the Mo-substituted alloy was able to increase the first cycle capacity to 408 mAh·g −1 , but the degradation rate in mAh·g −1 ·cycle −1 was still similar to that of standard testing. Electrochemical capacity was found to be closely related to BCC phase unit cell volume and width of the an extra small pressure plateau at around 0.3 MPa on the 30 °C pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) desorption isotherm.

Effects of the cations and anions of the additives on charge/discharge performance are discussed. The reduction potential of alkaline cations and radii of halogen anions were correlated with initial capacity and degradation of the metal hydride alloy. A synergistic effect between KOH and some oxyacid salt additives was observed and greatly influenced by the nature of the salt additives. It was suggested that both the formation of a solid film over the metal hydride surface and the promotion of proton transfer in the additives containing electrolytes led to a decreased degradation of the electrodes and an increased discharge capacity. 12 salt additives, NaC 2 H 3 O 2 , KC 2 H 3 O 2 , K 2 CO 3 , Rb 2 CO 3 , Cs 2 CO 3 , K 3 PO 4 , Na 2 WO 4 , Rb 2 SO 4 , Cs 2 SO 4 , NaF, KF, and KBr, were found to increase the corrosion resistance of the MgNi-based metal hydride alloy.

As the average Ni-content increases, C14 phase evolves into the C15 phase and a new σ-VNi phase emerges; lattice constants in BCC, C14, and TiNi phase all decrease; the main plateau pressure increases; both gaseous phase and electrochemical hydrogen storage capacities decrease; the pressure-concentration-temperature (PCT) absorption/desorption hysteresis decreases; both high-rate dischargeability (HRD) and bulk hydrogen diffusivity increase and then decrease; and the surface reaction current decreases. There is a capacity-rate tradeoff with the change in V/Ni content. Alloys with relatively lower Ni-content show higher capacities but inferior high-rate performance compared to commercially available AB 5 MH alloy. Increasing the Ni-content in this BCC-based multi-phase alloy can improve the high-rate capability over AB 5 alloy but with lower discharge capacities. The inferior surface reaction current in these alloys, compared to AB 5 , may be due to the smaller surface area, not the total volume, of the Ni clusters embedded in the surface oxide layer of the activated alloys.

Power Quality Issues of a Battery Fast Charging Station for a Fully-Electric Public Transport System in Gothenburg City,"Torbjörn Thiringer, Saeid Haghbin",2015,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries1010022,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/1/1/22/pdf?version=1446791925,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/1/1/22,47,"An automatic fast charger station with a power level of 120 kW is developed for city Bus Line 60 in Gothenburg, Sweden. There are some power quality issues towards the utility grid during the charger operation. The aim of this paper is to explain the project and to present the measurement results with respect to power quality issues. The main specifications of the battery, charger, charging infrastructure and bus route are explained. The measurement results show that the harmonic emission is within the prescribed limit despite the high amount of low-frequency harmonics because of a passive diode rectification. It is suggested to replace the passive diode rectifier with an active front-end converter to eliminate low order current harmonics and to obtain a unity power factor operation. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate a practical example of an electric charging system for an electric public transport system in Gothenburg. Full article"

Especially for medium or large scale solutions, the latter application confines a huge amount of energy within a small volume; however, increasing the hazard potential far above the common level. Furthermore, as the safety hazards of lithium ion cells have been known for years, impressively shown by several burning cars or laptops, the need for a further enhancement of the safety of these systems is rising. This manuscript presents measurements of the gas emission from lithium ion batteries in case of a malfunction for different scenarios, showing a large variety of species with mostly toxic to highly toxic properties. The measurements were carried out using a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), photoacoustic spectroscopy, and chemical analysis. It is shown that the inflammation of a cell can be overcome, also preventing a cascading effect to neighboring cells, but giving rise to worse toxic gas emission. Furthermore, a filtration concept is presented that decreases the concentration of the emitted components significantly and promises filtration below immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) equivalent levels.

Regions of the main AB 2 and the secondary TiNi (B2 structure) phases directly underneath the surface Zr oxide/hydroxide layers are considered electrochemically inactive. The surface of AB 2 is covered, on the atomic scale, by sheets of Ni 2 O 3 with direct access to electrolyte and voids, without the buffer oxide commonly seen in Si-free AB 2 alloys. This clean oxide/bulk metal alloy interface is believed to be the main source of the improvements in the low-temperature performance of Si-containing AB 2 alloys. Sporadic metallic-Ni clusters can be found in the surface Ni 2 O 3 region. However, the density of these clusters is much lower than the Ni-inclusions found in most typical metal hydride surface oxides. A high density of nano-sized metallic Ni-inclusions (1–3 nm) is found in regions associated with the TiNi secondary phase, i.e. , in the surface oxide layer and in the grain boundary, which can also contribute to enhancement of the electrochemical performance.

Two novel hollow carbon sphere (HCS) and nanoporous graphene (NP-GNS) additives were added into the LFMP/C composite to enhance electrochemical performance. The HCS and NP-GNS were prepared via a simple hydrothermal process. The characteristic properties of the composite cathode materials were examined by micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis (EA), and alternating current (AC) impedance methods. The coin cell was used to investigate the electrochemical performance at various rates. It was found that the specific discharge capacities of LFMP/C + 2% NP-GNS + 2% HCS composite cathode materials were 161.18, 154.71, 148.82, and 120.00 mAh·g −1 at 0.1C, 0.2C, 1C, and 10C rates, respectively.

These alloys are composed of BCC (major), TiNi (major), C14 (minor), and Ti 2 Ni (minor) phases. The BCC phase was found to be responsible for the visible equilibrium pressure plateau between 0.1 MPa and 1 MPa. The plateaus belonging to the other phases occurred below 0.005 MPa. Due to the synergetic effects of other non-BCC phases, the body-centered-tetragonal (BCT) intermediate step is skipped and the face-centered-cubic (FCC) hydride phase is formed directly. During hydrogenation in both gaseous phase and electrochemistry, the non-BCC phases were first charged to completion, followed by charging of the BCC phase. In the multi-phase system, the side with a higher work function along the grain boundary is believed to be the first region that becomes hydrogenated and will not be fully dehydrided after 8 h in vacuum at 300 °C. While there is a large step at approximately 50% of the maximum hydrogen storage for the equilibrium pressure measured in gaseous phase, the charge/discharge curves measured electrochemically are very smooth, indicating a synergetic effect between BCC and non-BCC phases in the presence of voltage and charge non-neutrality. Compared to the non-BCC phases, the C14 phase benefits while the TiNi phase deteriorates the high-rate dischargeability ( HRD ) of the alloys. These synergetic effects are explained by the preoccupied hydrogen sites on the side of the hydrogen storage phase near the grain boundary. Full article"

High investment costs of battery systems, however, prevent positive financial returns for most present residential battery installations in Germany. Tesla Motors, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA, USA) announced a novel battery system—the Powerwall—for only about 25% of the current German average market price. According to Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk, Germany is one of the key markets for their product. He has, however, not given numbers to support his statement. In this paper, we analyze the economic benefit of the Powerwall for end-users with respect to various influencing parameters: electricity price, aging characteristics of the batteries, topology of battery system coupling, subsidy schemes, and retrofitting of existing PV systems. Simulations show that three key-factors strongly influence economics: the price gap between electricity price and remuneration rate, the battery system’s investment cost, and the usable battery capacity. We reveal under which conditions a positive return on invest can be achieved and outline that the Powerwall could be a worthwhile investment in multiple, but not all, scenarios investigated. Resulting trends are generally transferrable to other home storage products. Full article"

The internal short resistance and the size of the affected area must be known as a minimum for determining the released heat and, in consequence, the temperatures. The internal short resistance of purpose-built dummy pouch cells, filled with electrolyte-like solvent without conductive salt, has thus been measured in a given short area under various compressive loads. The resistances for different short scenarios obtained are analyzed and described in a mathematical form. Short circuit experiments with dummy cells using an external power source have also been carried out. This set-up allows the measurement of the temperature evolution at a known current and a determination of the actual short resistance. The post-mortem analysis of the samples shows a correlation between the maximum temperatures, released short heat and the separator melt diameter. Full article"

The characterization of the battery voltage at different levels of SoC after the full relaxation would be very time consuming. In this paper, a fast method to extrapolate long relaxation voltage is proposed. It needs only one complete measurement of relaxation at one given SoC and could give accurate voltage estimation at other states of charge from short and partial measurement. This generic method was validated on three different cells and could be easily extended to any type of battery. Full article"

Moreover, while the PCT curves (up to around one third of the hydrogen storage capacity) reside in between the charge and discharge EPCT curves, the rest of the PCT curves are below the EPCT curves. Finally, we demonstrated a new calibration method based on the inflection points observed in the EPCT isotherms of a physical mixture of more than one alloy. This turning point can be used to find a preset calibration point to determine the state-of-charge. Full article"
Fundamentals of Using Battery Energy Storage Systems to Provide Primary Control Reserves in Germany,"Alexander Zeh, Marcus Müller, Maik Naumann, Holger C. Hesse, Andreas Jossen, Rolf Witzmann",2016,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries2030029,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/2/3/29/pdf?version=1473764877,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/2/3/29,95,"The application of stationary battery storage systems to German electrical grids can help with various storage services. This application requires controlling the charge and discharge power of such a system. For example, photovoltaic (PV) home storage, uninterruptible power supply, and storage systems for providing ancillary services such as primary control reserves (PCRs) represent battery applications with positive profitability. Because PCRs are essential for stabilizing grid frequency and maintaining a robust electrical grid, German transmission system operators (TSOs) released strict regulations in August 2015 for providing PCRs with battery storage systems as part of regulating the International Grid Control Cooperation (IGCC) region in Europe. These regulations focused on the permissible state of charge ( SoC ) of the battery during nominal and extreme conditions. The concomitant increased capacity demand oversizing may result in a significant profitability reduction, which can be attenuated only by using an optimal parameterization of the control algorithm for energy management of the storage systems. In this paper, the sizing optimization is achieved and a recommendation for a control algorithm that includes the appropriate parameters for the requirements in the German market is given. Furthermore, the storage cost is estimated, including battery aging simulations for different aging parameter sets to allow for a realistic profitability calculation. Full article"
Durability and Reliability of Electric Vehicle Batteries under Electric Utility Grid Operations.

The intention of this study is to test the impact of such strategies on the degradation of commercial Li-ion batteries. This first part looks into the preliminary testing performed prior to the start of degradation studies to ensure that the selected cells are compatible. Both the thermodynamic and kinetic cell-to-cell variation within the selected batch and the diagnostic-ability of the cells were investigated. The cells were found to have low cell-to-cell variations and are thus consistent. Moreover, the emulation of the full cell from the half-cell data prepared from harvested electrodes was successful and the degradation forecast showed that the main degradation modes can be differentiated.

Reproduction in bulk form of Mg 52 Ni 39 Co 3 Mn 6 alloy composition was prepared through a combination of melt spinning (MS) and mechanical alloying (MA), shows a sponge-like microstructure with >95% amorphous content, and is chosen as the metal hydride (MH) alloy for a sequence of electrolyte experiments with various hydroxides including LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH, and (C 2 H 5 ) 4 N(OH). The electrolyte conductivity is found to be closely related to cation size in the hydroxide compound used as 1 M additive to the 4 M KOH aqueous solution. The degradation performance of Mg 52 Ni 39 Co 3 Mn 6 alloy through cycling demonstrates a strong correlation with the redox potential of the cation in the alkali hydroxide compound used as 1 M additive to the 5 M KOH aqueous solution.

The first alloy was found to be composed of completely aligned Zr 7 Ni 10 grains with a ZrO 2 secondary phase randomly scattered throughout and a C15 secondary phase precipitated along the grain boundary. Two sets of orientation alignments were found between the Zr 7 Ni 10 grains and the C15 phase: (001) Zr7Ni10A //(110) C15 and [100] Zr7Ni10A //[0 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1] C15 , and (01 1 ¯ 1 ¯ ) Zr7Ni10B //( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 00) C15 and [100] Zr7Ni10B //[313] C15 . The grain growth direction is close to [313] Zr7Ni10B //[ 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 11] C15 . The second alloy is predominated by a C14 phase, as observed from X-ray diffraction analysis. Both the matrix and dendrite seen through a scanning electron microscope arise from the same C14 structure with a similar chemical composition, but different orientations, as the matrix with the secondary phases in the form of intervening Zr 7 Ni 10 /Zr 9 Ni 11 /(Zr,Ni)Ti needle-like phase coated with a thin layer of C15 phase.

The Importance of Rare-Earth Additions in Zr-Based AB2Metal Hydride Alloys,"Kwo-Hsiung Young, Taihei Ouchi, Jean Nei, Dhanashree Moghe",2016,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries2030025,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/2/3/25/pdf?version=1468216622,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/2/3/25,28,"Effects of substitutions of rare earth (RE) elements (Y, La, Ce, and Nd) to the Zr-based AB 2 multi-phase metal hydride (MH) alloys on the structure, gaseous phase hydrogen storage (H-storage), and electrochemical properties were studied and compared. Solubilities of the RE atoms in the main Laves phases (C14 and C15) are very low, and therefore the main contributions of the RE additives are through the formation of the RENi phase and change in TiNi phase abundance. Both the RENi and TiNi phases are found to facilitate the bulk diffusion of hydrogen but impede the surface reaction. The former is very effective in improving the activation behaviors. −40 °C performances of the Ce-doped alloys are slightly better than the Nd-doped alloys but not as good as those of the La-doped alloys, which gained the improvement through a different mechanism. While the improvement in ultra-low-temperature performance of the Ce-containing alloys can be associated with a larger amount of metallic Ni-clusters embedded in the surface oxide, the improvement in the La-containing alloys originates from the clean alloy/oxide interface as shown in an earlier transmission electron microscopy study. Overall, the substitution of 1 at% Ce to partially replace Zr gives the best electrochemical performances (capacity, rate, and activation) and is recommended for all the AB 2 MH alloys for electrochemical applications.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the multi-phase nature of all alloys, which were composed of a stoichiometric TiNi matrix, a hyperstoichiometric TiNi minor phase, and a Ti 2 Ni secondary phase. Improvement in synergetic effects between the main TiNi and secondary Ti 2 Ni phases, determined by the amount of distorted lattice region in TiNi near Ti 2 Ni, was accomplished by the substitution of an element with a higher work function, which consequently causes a dramatic increase in gaseous phase hydrogen storage capacity compared to the Ti 50 Zr 1 Ni 49 base alloy. Capacity performance is further enhanced in the electrochemical environment, especially in the cases of the Ti 50 Zr 1 Ni 49 base alloy and Ti 50 Zr 1 Ni 44 Co 5 alloy. Although the TiNi-based alloys in the current study show poorer high-rate performances compared to the commonly used AB 5 , AB 2 , and A 2 B 7 alloys, they have adequate capacity performances and also excel in terms of cost and cycle stability. Among the alloys investigated, the Ti 50 Zr 1 Ni 44 Fe 5 alloy demonstrated the best balance among capacity (394 mAh·g −1 ), high-rate performance, activation, and cycle stability and is recommended for follow-up full-cell testing and as the base composition for future formula optimization.

Alloy design strategies to further tune the electrochemical properties of these secondary phases include the use of additives and processing techniques to manipulate the chemical nature and the microstructure of these materials. It is also of particular interest to observe the engineering of constitutional point defects and how they may affect electrochemical properties and performance. The Zr 7 Ni 10 phase appears particularly prone to point defects, and we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations coupled with a statistical mechanics model to study the theoretical point defects. The Zr 2 Ni 7 phase appears less prone to point defects, and we use the Zr 2 Ni 7 point defect model, as well as experimental lattice parameters, with Zr 7 Ni 10 phases from X-ray diffraction (XRD) as points of comparison. The point defect models indicate that anti-site defects tend to form in the Zr 7 Ni 10 phase, and that these defects form more easily in the Zr 7 Ni 10 phase than the Zr 2 Ni 7 phase, as expected.

The electrochemical properties of the Co-substituted A 2 B 7 and the failure mechanisms of cells using such alloys cycled at RT have been reported previously. In this paper, the failure mechanisms of the same alloys cycled at 50 °C are reported. Compared to that at RT, the trend of the cycle life at 50 °C versus the Co content in the Co-substituted A 2 B 7 HAAs is similar, but the cycle life is significantly shorter. Failure analysis of the cells at 50 °C was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. It was found that the elevated temperature accelerates electrolyte dry-out and the deterioration (both pulverization and oxidation) of the A 2 B 7 negative electrode, which are major causes of cell failure when cycling at 50 °C. Cells from HAA with higher Co-content also showed micro-shortage in the separator from the debris of the corrosion of the negative electrode. Full article"

Thus, in order to evaluate their techno-economic viability for a certain application, detailed information about Li-ion battery performance behavior becomes necessary. This paper proposes a comprehensive seven-step methodology for laboratory characterization of Li-ion batteries, in which the battery’s performance parameters (i.e., capacity, open-circuit voltage ( OCV ), and impedance) are determined and their dependence on the operating conditions are obtained. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid procedure for parameterizing the batteries’ equivalent electrical circuit (EEC), which is used to emulate the batteries’ dynamic behavior. Based on this novel parameterization procedure, the performance model of the studied Li-ion battery is developed and its accuracy is successfully verified (maximum error lower than 5% and a mean error below 8.5 mV) for various load profiles (including a real application profile), thus validating the proposed seven-step characterization methodology.

Electrolyte Additive Concentration for Maximum Energy Storage in Lead-Acid Batteries,Andreas Paglietti,2016,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries2040036,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/2/4/36/pdf?version=1479984173,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/2/4/36,7,"This paper presents a method to assess the effect of electrolyte additives on the energy capacity of Pb-acid batteries.

An experimental procedure to determine this range is presented. The obtained results provide a way to assess the potential of electrolyte additives to improve the energy capacity of Pb-acid batteries.

Addition of Fe increases the lattice constants and abundance of the main Ce 2 Ni 7 phase, decreases the NdNi 3 phase abundance, and increases the CaCu 5 phase when the Fe content is above 2.3 at%. For the gaseous phase hydrogen storage (H-storage), Fe incorporation does not change the storage capacity or equilibrium pressure, but it does decrease the change in both entropy and enthalpy. With regard to electrochemistry, >2.3 at% Fe decreases both the full and high-rate discharge capacities due to the deterioration in both bulk transport (caused by decreased secondary phase abundance and consequent lower synergetic effect) and surface electrochemical reaction (caused by the lower volume of the surface metallic Ni inclusions). In a low-temperature environment (−40 °C), although Fe increases the reactive surface area, it also severely hinders the ability of the surface catalytic, leading to a net increase in surface charge-transfer resistance. Even though Fe increases the abundance of the beneficial Ce 2 Ni 7 phase with a trade-off for the relatively unfavorable NdNi 3 phase, it also deteriorates the electrochemical performance due to a less active surface. Therefore, further surface treatment methods that are able to increase the surface catalytic ability in Fe-containing superlattice alloys and potentially reveal the positive contributions that Fe provides structurally are worth investigating in the future.

Due to the fact that energy production is one of the primary contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, it is obvious that more environmentally friendly sources of power are required. Technologies such as solar and wind power are constantly being improved through research; however, as these technologies are often sporadic in their power generation, efforts must be made to establish ways to store this sustainable energy when conditions for generation are not ideal. Battery storage is one possible supplement to these renewable energy technologies; however, as current Li-ion technology is reaching its theoretical capacity, new battery technology must be investigated. Lithium–sulphur (Li–S) batteries are receiving much attention as a potential replacement for Li-ion batteries due to their superior capacity, and also their abundant and environmentally benign active materials. In the spirit of environmental harm minimization, efforts have been made to use sustainable carbonaceous materials for applications as carbon–sulphur (C–S) composite cathodes, carbon interlayers, and carbon-modified separators. This work reports on the various applications of carbonaceous materials applied to Li–S batteries, and provides perspectives for the future development of Li–S batteries with the aim of preparing a high energy density, environmentally friendly, and sustainable sulphur-based cathode with long cycle life.

Heat generation is dominated by the irreversible component associated with cell overpotential, although evidence of the reversible component is also observed, associated with the heat related to entropy from the electrode reactions. The final charging stages (i.e., 1C-CV) significantly reduce heat generation and cell temperature during charge, resulting in a thermally safe charging protocol. Cell heat capacity was determined from cell-specific heats and the cell materials’ thickness. The model adjustment of the experimental data during the 2 min resting period between discharge and charge allowed us to calculate both the time constant of the relaxation process and the cell thermal resistance. The obtained values of these thermal parameters used in the proposed model are almost equal to those found in the literature for the same cell model, which suggests that the proposed model is suitable for its implementation in thermal management systems.

Various factors for the OCV behavior, such as resting period, step-size of the pulse test, testing current amplitude, hysteresis phenomena, and terminal voltage relationship, are investigated and evaluated. To this end, a general OCV model based on state of charge ( SOC ) tracking is developed and validated with satisfactory results. Full article"

All three methods can produce α-Ni(OH) 2 or α/β mixed-Ni(OH) 2 with capacities higher than that of conventional β-Ni(OH) 2 and a stable cycle performance. The second method produces a special core–shell β-Ni(OH) 2 /α-Ni(OH) 2 structure with an excellent cycle stability in the flooded half-cell configuration, is innovative and also already mass-production ready. The core–shell structure has been investigated by both scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The shell portion of the particle is composed of α-Ni(OH) 2 nano-crystals embedded in a β-Ni(OH) 2 matrix, which helps to reduce the stress originating from the lattice expansion in the β-α transformation.

Domain Size of Phase-Separated NaxCoO2as Investigated by X-Ray Microdiffraction,"Hideharu Niwa, Takayuki Shibata, Yasuhiko Imai, Shigeru Kimura, Yutaka Moritomo",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3010005,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/1/5/pdf?version=1488453847,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/1/5,3,"O3-NaCoO 2 2 is a promising cathode material for sodium ion secondary batteries (SIBs). Na x x CoO 2 2 shows phase separation (PS) into the O3 and O ′ ′ 3 phases in the Na concentration range of 0.89 ⩽ x ⩽ ⩽ x ⩽ 0.99. In order to estimate the domain size ( r ) in the two-phase region, we performed X-ray microdiffraction (XRMD) of thin films of Na x x CoO 2 2 at x = 0.97 and ∼1. We found that r (≈400 nm) of the O ′ ′ 3 domain is comparable to the particle size d (=331 ± 87 nm) in the as-grown O3-NaCoO 2 2 film. This observation suggests that individual particles of Na x x CoO 2 2 are single phase to minimize the strain at the O3–O ′ ′ 3 phase boundary. Full article"

As an alternative to water, ionic liquid (IL)-based electrolyte has been shown to exhibit excellent proton conducting properties and a wide electrochemical stability window, and can be used in proton conducting batteries. In this study, we used IL/acid mixtures to replace the 30 wt % KOH aqueous electrolyte in nickel/metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries, and verified the proton conducting character of these mixtures through electrochemical charge/discharge experiments. Dilution of ILs with acetic acid was found to effectively increase proton conductivity. By using 2 M acetic acid in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, stable charge/discharge characteristics were obtained, including low charge/discharge overpotentials, a discharge voltage plateau at ~1.2 V, a specific capacity of 161.9 mAh·g −1 , and a stable cycling performance for an AB 5 metal hydride anode with a (Ni,Co,Zn)(OH) 2 cathode.

Test Method for Thermal Characterization of Li-Ion Cells and Verification of Cooling Concepts,"Rouven Christen, Gerhard Rizzo, Alfred Gadola, Max Stöck",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3010003,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/1/3/pdf?version=1485424446,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/1/3,33,"Temperature gradients, thermal cycling and temperatures outside the optimal operation range can have a significant influence on the reliability and lifetime of Li-ion battery cells. Therefore, it is essential for the developer of large-scale battery systems to know the thermal characteristics, such as heat source location, heat capacity and thermal conductivity, of a single cell in order to design appropriate cooling measures. This paper describes an advanced test facility, which allows not only an estimation of the thermal properties of a battery cell, but also the verification of proposed cooling strategies in operation. To do this, an active measuring unit consisting of a temperature and heat flux density sensor and a Peltier element was developed. These temperature/heat flux sensing (THFS) units are uniformly arranged around a battery cell with a spatial resolution of 25 mm. Consequently, the temperature or heat flux density can be controlled individually, thus forming regions with constant temperature (cooling) or zero heat flux (insulation). This test setup covers the whole development loop from thermal characterization to the design and verification of the proposed cooling strategy. Full article"

Compared to other battery technologies, e.g., lithium-ion batteries, metal–air batteries offer the possibility to physically stop the battery operation by stopping its air supply, thus offering an additional protection against severe battery damage in the case of, e.g., an accidental short circuit. This method may also reduce the electrical hazard in a larger battery system since, by stopping the air supply, the voltage can be brought to zero while maintaining the energy capacity of the battery. Measurements of overdischarge currents and current cut-off by suffocation have been performed to assess the safety of this type of Zn–air battery. The time to get to zero battery voltage is shown to mainly be determined by the volume of air trapped in the cell. Full article"

The arc melted alloy was divided into three samples, two of which were separately quartz-sealed under vacuum and heated to 1000 °C for 1 h; one of these samples was quenched and the other furnace-cooled to ambient temperature. The crystal structures of the samples were studied via X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation characteristics were investigated using a Sievert apparatus. Potentiostat corrosion tests on the alloys were performed using an AutoLab ® corrosion test apparatus and electrochemical cell. All samples exhibited a major body-center-cubic (BCC) and some secondary phases. An abundance of Laves phases that were found in the as-cast sample reduced with annealing and disappeared in the quenched sample. Beside suppressing Laves phase, annealing also introduced a Ti-rich phase. The corrosion rate, maximum absorption, and useful capacities increased after both heat treatments. The annealed sample had the highest absorption and reversible capacity. The plateau pressure of the as-cast alloy increased after quenching. The corrosion rate increased from 0.0004 mm/y in the as-cast sample to 0.0009 mm/y after annealing and 0.0017 mm/y after quenching. Full article"

The increase in the integration of renewable energy sources is one of the major contributors to the increase in the number of SBS. SBS are also used in other applications such as peak load management, load-shifting, voltage regulation and power quality improvement. Accurately modeling the charging/discharging characteristics of such SBS at various instances (charging/discharging profile) is vital for many applications. Capacity loss due to the aging of the batteries is an important factor to be considered for estimating the charging/discharging profile of SBS more accurately. Empirical modeling is a common approach used in the literature for estimating capacity loss, which is further used for estimating the charging/discharging profiles of SBS. However, in the case of SBS used for renewable integration and other grid related applications, machine-learning (ML) based models provide extreme flexibility and require minimal resources for implementation. The models can even leverage existing smart meter data to estimate the charging/discharging profile of SBS. In this paper, an analysis on the performance of different ML approaches that can be applied for lithium iron phosphate battery systems and vanadium redox flow battery systems used as SBS is presented for the scenarios where the aging of individual cells is non-uniform.

Electrochemical batteries have emerged as the preferred choice for most of the consumer product applications. Cost reduction of batteries will accelerate the growth in all of these sectors. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) and solid-state batteries are showing promise through their downward price and upward performance trends. We may achieve further performance improvement and cost reduction for Li-ion and solid-state batteries through reduction of the variation in physical and electrical properties. These properties can be improved and made uniform by considering the electrical model of batteries and adopting novel manufacturing approaches. Using quantum-photo effect, the incorporation of ultra-violet (UV) assisted photo-thermal processing can reduce metal surface roughness. Using in-situ measurements, advanced process control (APC) can help ensure uniformity among the constituent electrochemical cells. Industrial internet of things (IIoT) can streamline the production flow. In this article, we have examined the issue of electrochemical battery manufacturing of Li-ion and solid-state type from cell-level to battery-level process variability, and proposed potential areas where improvements in the manufacturing process can be made. By incorporating these practices in the manufacturing process we expect reduced cost of energy management system, improved reliability and yield gain with the net saving of manufacturing cost being at least 20%.

Influence of Using Metallic Na on the Interfacial and Transport Properties of Na-Ion Batteries,"Maider Zarrabeitia, Miguel Ángel Muñoz-Márquez, Francesco Nobili, Teófilo Rojo, Montse Casas-Cabanas",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3020016,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/2/16/pdf?version=1494403168,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/2/16,20,"Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 is a promising negative electrode for rechargeable Na-ion batteries; however, its good properties in terms of insertion voltage and specific capacity are hampered by the poor capacity retention reported in the past. The interfacial and ionic/electronic properties are key factors to understanding the electrochemical performance of Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 . Therefore, its study is of utmost importance. In addition, although rather unexplored, the use of metallic Na in half-cell studies is another important issue due to the fact that side-reactions will be induced when metallic Na is in contact with the electrolyte. Hence, in this work the interfacial and transport properties of full Na-ion cells have been investigated and compared with half-cells upon electrochemical cycling by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (conventional XPS and Auger parameter analysis) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The half-cell has been assembled with C-coated Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 against metallic Na whilst the full-cell uses C-coated Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 as negative electrode and NaFePO 4 as positive electrode, delivering 112 Wh/kg anode+cathode in the 2nd cycle. When comparing both types of cells, it has been found that the interfacial properties, the OCV (open circuit voltage) and the electrode–-electrolyte interphase behavior are more stable in the full-cell than in the half-cell. The electronic transition from insulator to conductor previously observed in a half-cell for Na 2 Ti 3 O 7 has also been detected in the full-cell impedance analysis. Full article"

The methods involved heating electrodes of spent lead acid batteries in methanesulfonic acid and hydrogen peroxide to dissolve solid lead and lead dioxide out of the electrode material. The processes yielded lead methanesulfonate, which is an electrolyte for the soluble lead acid battery. The lead (II) ions in the electrolyte were identified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy and their electrochemistry confirmed using cyclic voltammetry. The concentration of lead (II) ions was determined and it was found that using the higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide yielded the highest concentration of lead (II) ions. The method was therefore found to be sufficient to make electrolyte for a soluble lead cell. Full article"

New procedures for measuring the external and internal pressure change of cells were developed. The external pressure was measured utilizing a gas-tight cylinder inside the calorimeter chamber, in order to detect the venting of the cells. For internal pressure measurements, a pressure line connected to a pressure transducer was directly inserted into the cell. During the thermal runaway experiments, three stages (low rate, medium rate, and high rate reactions) were observed. Both the pressure and temperature change indicated different stages of exothermic reactions, which produced gases or/and heat. The onset temperature of the thermal runaway was estimated according to the temperature and pressure changes. Moreover, the different activation energies for the exothermic reactions could be derived from Arrhenius plots. Full article"
High-Fidelity Battery Model for Model Predictive Control Implemented into a Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle,"Nicolas Sockeel, Masood Shahverdi, Michael Mazzola, William Meadows",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3020013,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/2/13/pdf?version=1491480916,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/2/13,16,"Power management strategies have impacts on fuel economy, greenhouse gasses (GHG) emission, as well as effects on the durability of power-train components. This is why different off-line and real-time optimal control approaches are being developed. However, real-time control seems to be more attractive than off-line control because it can be directly implemented for managing power and energy flows inside an actual vehicle. One interesting illustration of these power management strategies is the model predictive control (MPC) based algorithm. Inside a MPC, a cost function is optimized while system constraints are validated in real time. The MPC algorithm relies on dynamic models of the vehicle and the battery. The complexity and accuracy of the battery model are usually neglected to benefit the development of new cost functions or better MPC algorithms. The contribution of this manuscript consists of developing and evaluating a high-fidelity battery model of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that has been used for MPC. Via empirical work and simulation, the impact of a high-fidelity battery model has been evaluated and compared to a simpler model in the context of MPC. It is proven that the new battery model reduces the absolute voltage, state of charge ( SoC ), and battery power loss error by a factor of 3.2, 1.9 and 2.1 on average respectively, compared to the simpler battery model.

The proposed techniques use the battery’s terminal voltage and current to estimate the OCV, which is correlated to the state of charge (SOC). Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in online estimation at different charge/discharge conditions and temperatures.

The investigation focuses on LiMnPO4, which could offer an improved cell potential (4.1 V) with respect to the reference LiFePO4 compound, but it is characterized by poor lithium intercalation/de-intercalation kinetics. Substitution of cations like Co and Ni in the olivine structure of LiMnPO4 was recently reported in an attempt to improve the electrochemical performances. Here the electronic structure and lithium intercalation potential of Ni- and Co-doped LiMnPO4 were calculated in the framework of the Hubbard U density functional theory (DFT+U) method for highly correlated materials. Moreover, the diffusion process of lithium in the host structures was simulated, and the activation barriers in the doped and pristine structures were compared. Our calculation predicted that doping increases Li insertion potential while activation barriers for Li diffusion remain similar to the pristine material. Moreover, Ni and Co doping induces the formation of impurity states near the Fermi level and significantly reduces the band gap of LiMnPO4. Full article"

The incorporation of Fe does not lead to improved cell capacity or cycle life at either room or low temperature, although Fe promotes the formation of a favorable Ce 2 Ni 7 phase. Fe-substitution was found to inhibit leaching of Al from the metal hydride negative electrode and promote leaching of Co, which could potentially extend the cycle life of the positive electrode. The failure mechanisms of the cycled cells with the Fe-substituted superlattice hydrogen absorbing alloys were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma analysis. The failure of cells with Fe-free and low Fe-content alloys is mainly attributed to the pulverization of the metal hydride alloy. Meanwhile, severe oxidation/corrosion of the negative electrode is observed for cells with high Fe-content alloys, resulting in increased internal cell resistance, formation of micro-shortages in the separator and eventual cell failure.

Pd enters the A-site of both the C14 and C15 Laves phases and shrinks the unit cell volumes, which results in a decrease of both gaseous phase and electrochemical hydrogen storage capacities. On the other hand, the addition of Pd benefits both the bulk transport of hydrogen and the surface electrochemical reaction. Improvements in high-rate dischargeability and low-temperature performances are solely due to an increase in surface catalytic ability. Addition of Pd also decreases the surface reactive area, but such properties can be mediated through incorporation of additional modifications with rare earth elements.

To overcome this challenge, a new intelligent method using a combination of fuzzy controller and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) techniques for active power controllers in isolated networks is proposed. In this paper, COA is compared with genetic algorithm (GA) and particles swarm optimization algorithm (PSO).

Yartys",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3030022,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/3/22/pdf?version=1501246463,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/3/22,39,"Herein, we present a comparison of the electrochemical hydrogen-storage characteristics of two state-of-art Laves phase-based metal hydride alloys (Zr 21.5 Ti 12.0 V 10.0 Cr 7.5 Mn 8.1 Co 8.0 Ni 32.2 Sn 0.3 Al 0.4 vs. Zr 25.0 Ti 6.5 V 3.9 Mn 22.2 Fe 3.8 Ni 38.0 La 0.3 ) prepared by induction melting and hydrogen decrepitation. The relatively high contents of lighter transition metals (V and Cr) in the first composition results in an average electron density below the C14/C15 threshold ( e / a ~ 6.9 ) ( e / a ~ 6.9 ) and produces a C14-predominated structure, while the average electron density of the second composition is above the C14/C15 threshold and results in a C15-predominated structure. From a combination of variations in composition, main phase structure, and degree of homogeneity, the C14-predominated alloy exhibits higher storage capacities (in both the gaseous phase and electrochemical environment), a slower activation, inferior high-rate discharge, and low-temperature performances, and a better cycle stability compared to the C15-predominated alloy. The superiority in high-rate dischargeability in the C15-predominated alloy is mainly due to its larger reactive surface area. Annealing of the C15-predominated alloy eliminates the ZrNi secondary phase completely and changes the composition of the La-containing secondary phase. While the former change sacrifices the synergetic effects, and degrades the hydrogen storage performance, the latter may contribute to the unchanged surface catalytic ability, even with a reduction in total volume of metallic nickel clusters embedded in the activated surface oxide layer. In general, the C14-predominated alloy is more suitable for high-capacity and long cycle life applications, and the C15-predominated alloy can be used in areas requiring easy activation, and better high-rate and low-temperature performances.

"On-Line Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on the Optimized Gray Model GM(1,1)","Dong Zhou, Long Xue, Yijia Song, Jiayu Chen",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3030021,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/3/21/pdf?version=1499495972,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/3/21,37,"Lithium-ion battery on-line remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has become increasingly popular. The capacity and internal resistance are often used as the batteries’ health indicator (HI) for quantifying degradation and predicting the RUL. However, the capacity and internal resistance are too difficult to measure on-line due to the batteries’ internal state variables being inaccessible to sensors under operational conditions. In addition, measuring these variables requires accurate measurement devices, which can be expensive, and have limited applicability in practice. In this paper, a novel HI is extracted from the operating parameters of lithium-ion batteries for degradation models and RUL prediction. Moreover, the Box–Cox transformation is applied to improve the correlation between the extracted HI and the battery’s real capacity. Then, Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses are utilized to assess the similarity between the real capacity and the estimated capacity derived from the HI. An optimized gray model GM(1,1) is employed to predict the RUL based on the presented HI. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and accurate for battery degradation modeling and RUL prediction. Full article"

However, presently there are few synthetic routes to antimony particles for use in sodium-ion batteries. One pot, sol-gel synthetic routes from readily available, chloride-free precursors have been developed. The resulting products have been characterized and, from this data, several key parameters’ optimization have been identified and are presented here. Finally, using this information, some initial optimization has been carried out, which resulted in minor improvements to the physical and electrochemical properties of the resulting product.

Effects of Cs2CO3Additive in KOH Electrolyte Used in Ni/MH Batteries,"Shuli Yan, Jean Nei, Peifeng Li, Kwo-Hsiung Young, K. Y. Simon Ng",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3040041,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/4/41/pdf?version=1513607517,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/4/41,9,"The effects of Cs 2 CO 3 addition in a KOH-based electrolyte were investigated for applications in nickel/metal hydride batteries. Both MgNi-based and Laves phase-related body-centered cubic solid solution metal hydride alloys were tested as the anode active materials, and sintered β -Ni(OH) 2 was used as the cathode active material. Certain amounts of Cs 2 CO 3 additive in the KOH-based electrolyte improved the electrochemical performances compared with a conventional pure KOH electrolyte. For example, with Laves phase-related body-centered cubic alloys, the addition of Cs 2 CO 3 to the electrolyte improved cycle stability (for all three alloys) and discharge capacity (for the Al-containing alloys); moreover, in the 0.33 M Cs 2 CO 3 + 6.44 M KOH electrolyte, the discharge capacity of Mg 52 Ni 39 Co 3 Mn 6 increased to 132%, degradation decreased to 87%, and high-rate dischargeability stayed the same compared with the conventional 6.77 M KOH electrolyte. The effects of Cs 2 CO 3 on the physical and chemical properties of Mg 52 Ni 39 Co 3 Mn 6 were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results from these analyses concluded that Cs 2 CO 3 addition changed both the alloy surface and bulk composition. A fluffy layer containing carbon was found covering the metal particle surface after cycling in the Cs 2 CO 3 -containing electrolyte, and was considered to be the main cause of the reduction in capacity degradation during cycling. Also, the Cs 2 CO 3 additive promoted the formations of the C–O and C=O bonds on the alloy surface. The C–O and C=O bonds were believed to be active sites for proton transfer during the electrochemical process, with the C–O bond being the more effective of the two. Both bonds contributed to a higher surface catalytic ability. The addition of 0.33 M Cs 2 CO 3 was deemed optimal in this study. Full article"

The conversion rate of LaNi 5 increased from 86.8% into 98.2%, and the A 2 B 7 phase abundance increased from 42.5 to 45.8 wt % and reduced to 39.2 wt % with the increase in process time from four to 32 h. During the first stage of reaction, Mg formed discrete grains with the same orientation, which was closely related to the orientation of the host LaNi 5 alloy. Mg then diffused through the ab -phase of LaNi 5 and formed the AB 2 , AB 3 , and A 2 B 7 phases. Diffusion of Mg stalled at the grain boundary of the host LaNi 5 alloy. Good alignments in the c -axis between the newly formed superlattice phases and LaNi 5 were observed. The density of high-angle grain boundary decreased with the increase in process time and was an indication of lattice cracking. Full article"

In spite of their significant losses and other limitations, passive equalizers (PEQ) are used in most applications because they are relatively simple and low cost. Active equalizers (AEQ) reduce these PEQ problems, but are not as widely used due to their much higher cost and complexity. A new hybrid circuit called the Bilevel EQU (BEQ) combines the PEQ and AEQ to provide much higher performance than a pure PEQ but at a much lower cost than a pure AEQ. Full article"

The core-shell materials were fabricated with a continuous co-precipitation process, which created an Al-poor core and an Al-rich shell during the nucleation and particle growth stages, respectively. The Al-rich shell became α -Ni(OH) 2 after electrical activation and remained intact through the cycling. Pouch cells with the high-capacity β - α core-shell positive electrode material show higher charge acceptances and discharge capacities at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, and 1C, improved self-discharge performances, and reduced internal and surface charge-transfer resistances, at both room temperature and −10 °C when compared to those with the standard positive electrode material. While the high capacity of the core-shell material can be attributed to the α phase with a multi-electron transfer capability, the improvement in high-rate capability (lower resistance) is caused by the unique surface morphology and abundant interface sites at the β - α grain boundaries. Gravimetric energy densities of pouch cells made with the high-capacity and standard positive materials are 127 and 110 Wh·kg −1 , respectively. A further improvement in capacity is expected via the continued optimization of pouch design and the use of high-capacity metal hydride alloy. Full article"

Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT) on metallic current collectors with low interface resistance are used as current collectors for the chemical solution infiltration of electroactive oxides to produce vertically aligned carbon nanotubes decorated with in situ grown LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) nanoparticles. The production processes steps (catalyst coating, VACNT chemical vapor deposition (CVD), infiltration, and thermal transformation) are all scalable, continuous, and suitable for niche market production to achieve high oxide loadings up to 70 wt %. Due to their unique transport structure, as-prepared nanoarrays achieve remarkably high power densities up to 2.58 kW kg −1 , which is based on the total electrode mass at 80 C for LiMn 2 O 4 //Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 full cells. The tailoring of LTO and LMO nanoparticle size (~20–100 nm) and VACNT length (array height: 60–200 µm) gives insights into the rate-limiting steps at high current for these kinds of nanoarray electrodes at very high C-rates of up to 200 C. The results reveal the critical structural parameters for achieving high power densities in VACNT nanoarray full cells. Full article"

In general, as the boron content in the alloy increased, the high-rate dischargeability, surface exchange current, and double-layer capacitance first decreased and then increased whereas charge-transfer resistance and dot product of charge-transfer resistance and double-layer capacitance changed in the opposite direction. Electrochemical and gaseous phase characteristics of two boron-containing alloys, with the same boron content detected by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer, showed significant variations in performances due to the difference in phase abundance of a newly formed tetragonal V 3 B 2 phase. This new phase contributes to the increases in electrochemical high-rate dischargeability, surface exchange current, charge-transfer resistances at room, and low temperatures. However, the V 3 B 2 phase does not contribute to the hydrogen storage capacities in either gaseous phase and electrochemical environment. Full article"

At room temperature, cells made with the superlattice alloy showed a 40% lower internal resistance and a 59% lower surface charge-transfer resistance compared to cells made with the AB 5 alloy. At a low temperature (−10 °C), cells made with the superlattice alloy demonstrated an 18% lower internal resistance and a 60% lower surface charge-transfer resistance compared to cells made with the AB 5 alloy. Cells made with the superlattice alloy exhibited a better charge retention at −10 °C. A cycle life comparison in a regular cell configuration indicated that the Al-free superlattice alloy contributes to a shorter cycle life as a result of the pulverization from the lattice expansion of the main phase.

Thermal Characteristics of Conversion-Type FeOF Cathode in Li-ion Batteries,"Liwei Zhao, Ayuko Kitajou, Shigeto Okada",2017,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries3040033,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/4/33/pdf?version=1508738998,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/3/4/33,4,"Rutile FeOF was used as a conversion-type cathode material for Li-ion batteries. In the present study, 0.6Li, 1.4Li, and 2.7Li per mole lithiation reactions were carried out by changing the electrochemical discharge reaction depth. The thermal characteristics of the FeOF cathode were investigated by thermogravimetric mass spectrometric (TG-MS) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) systems. No remarkable HF release was detected, even up to 700 °C, which indicated a low toxic risk for the FeOF cathode. Changes in the thermal properties of the FeOF cathode via different conversion reaction depths in the associated electrolyte were studied by changing the cathode/electrolyte ratio in the mixture. LiFeOF was found to exothermically react with the electrolyte at about 210 °C. Similar exothermic reactions were found with charged FeOF cathodes because of the irreversible Li ions. Among the products of the conversion reaction of FeOF, Li 2 O was found to exothermically react with the electrolyte at about 120 °C, which induced the main thermal risk of the FeOF cathode. It suggests that the oxygen-containing conversion-type cathodes have a higher thermal risk than the oxygen-free ones, but controlling the cathode/electrolyte ratio in cells successfully reduced the thermal risk. Finally, the thermal stability of the FeOF cathode was evaluated in comparison with FeF 3 and LiFePO 4 cathodes. Full article"

The value of electromotive force (emf) measured depends on the temperature of the sample and on the pressure of water vapor in the storage atmosphere and reaches approximately 1 V. Volt-ampere characteristics were investigated at different conditions to yield a model of emf generation in these structures. It was found that the reaction of water with silicon nanoparticles is the prime reason behind emf generation. Such a source may be introduced into electronic paper, and employed in the next generation of smart cards. The structure may also be manufactured directly on the surface of silicon chips, such as on the back of crystals in microschemes. Full article"

Cells made from Alloy C15 showed a higher high-rate performance and peak power with a corresponding sacrifice in capacity, low-temperature performance, charge retention, and cycle life when compared with the C14 counterpart (Alloy C14). Annealing of the Alloy C15 eliminated the ZrNi secondary phase and further improved the high-rate and peak power performance. This treatment on Alloy C15 showed the best low-temperature performance, but also contributed to a less-desirable high-temperature voltage stand and an inferior cycle stability. While the main failure mode for Alloy C14 in the sealed cell is the formation of a thick oxide layer that prevents gas recombination during overcharge and consequent venting of the cell, the failure mode for Alloy C15 is dominated by continuous pulverization related to the volumetric changes during hydride formation and hysteresis in the pressure-composition-temperature isotherm. The leached-out Mn from Alloy C15 formed a high density of oxide deposits in the separator, leading to a deterioration in charge retention performance. Large amounts of Zr were found in the positive electrode of the cycled cell containing Alloy C15, but did not appear to harm cell performance. Suggestions for further composition and process optimization for Alloy C15 are also provided. Full article"

Untreated natural graphite samples contain 45–50% carbon by weight; the rest is composed of different elements such as aluminium, calcium, iron, silicon and oxygen, which are present as calcium carbonate and silicates of aluminium and iron. Our results confirm that in the GO and GNS synthesized, calcium is removed due to oxidation, though other impurities are maintained because they are not affected by the synthesis. Despite the remaining mineral phases, the energy storage capacity of GNS electrodes is very promising. In addition, an electrochemical comparison between GNS and NG demonstrated that the specific capacity in GNS is higher during the whole cycling process, 770 mA·g −1 at 100th cycle, which is twice that of graphite.

Galvanostatic investigations were conducted in the form of complete discharge and charging cycles in electrolyte excess. Coated 30 μm zinc particles provide the best rechargeability after complete discharge. The coatings reached an average charge capacity over 20 cycles of 113 mAh/g compared to the known zero rechargeability of uncoated zinc particles. Proposed reasons for the prolonged cycle life are effective immobilization of discharge products in the glass layer and the formation of percolating metallic bismuth and zinc phases, forming a conductive network through the glass matrix. The coating itself is carried out by mechanical ball milling. Different coating parameters and the resulting coating quality as well as their influence on the passivation and on the rechargeability of zinc–glass composites is investigated. Optimized coating qualities with respect to adhesion, homogeneity and compactness of the glass layer are achieved at defined preparation conditions, providing a glass coating content of almost 5 wt % for 250 μm zinc particles and almost 11 wt % for 30 μm zinc particles.

All of the electrolytes tested have low T g and are thermally stable ≥100 °C, and with TFSI as the exclusive anion the electrolytes (set A) have higher thermal stabilities ≥125 °C. Ionic conductivities are in the range of 1 mS/cm at 100 °C and slightly higher for set A PIL el , which, however, have lower oxidation stabilities than set B PIL el with both FSI and TFSI anions present: 3.4–3.7 V vs. 4.2 V. The evolution of the interfacial resistance increases for all PIL el during the first 40 h, but are much lower for set B PIL el and generally decrease with increasing Li-salt content. The higher interfacial resistances only influence the cycling performance at high C-rates (1 C), where set B PIL el with high Li-salt content performs better, while the discharge capacities at the 0.1 C rate are comparable. Long-term cycling at 0.5 C, however, shows stable discharge capacities for 100 cycles, with the exception of the set B PIL el with high Li-salt content. Altogether, the presence of both FSI and TFSI anions in the PIL el results in lower ionic conductivities and decreased thermal stabilities, but also higher oxidation stabilities and reduced interfacial resistances and, in total, result in an improved rate capability, but compromised long-term capacity retention. Overall, these electrolytes open for novel designs of HT-LIBs. Full article"

Herein, we present a novel method for preparing nanometric slabs of Na 0.44 MnO 2 , making use of the eco-friendly urea within a solution synthesis approach. This kind of preparation greatly reduces the time of reaction, decreases the thermal treatment temperature, and allows the obtaining of particles with smaller dimensions compared with those obtained through conventional solid-state synthesis. Such a decrease in particle size guarantees improved electrochemical performance, particularly at high current densities, where kinetic limitations become relevant. Indeed, the materials produced via solution synthesis outperform those prepared via solid-state synthesis both at 2 C, (95 mA h g −1 vs. 85 mA h g −1 , respectively) and 5 C, (78 mA h g −1 vs. 68.5 mA h g −1 , respectively). Additionally, the former material is rather stable over 200 cycles, with a high capacity retention of 75.7%. Full article"

However, most of these materials suffer from high 1st cycle active lithium losses, e.g., caused by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, which in turn hinder their broad commercial use so far. In general, the loss of active lithium permanently decreases the available energy by the consumption of lithium from the positive electrode material. Pre-lithiation is considered as a highly appealing technique to compensate for active lithium losses and, therefore, to increase the practical energy density. Various pre-lithiation techniques have been evaluated so far, including electrochemical and chemical pre-lithiation, pre-lithiation with the help of additives or the pre-lithiation by direct contact to lithium metal. In this review article, we will give a comprehensive overview about the various concepts for pre lithiation and controversially discuss their advantages and challenges. Furthermore, we will critically discuss possible effects on the cell performance and stability and assess the techniques with regard to their possible commercial exploration. Full article"

Any internal defective features that induce a short circuit, can trigger a thermal runaway: a cascade of reactions, leading to a device fire. As consumer device manufacturers push aggressively for increased battery energy, instances of field failure are increasingly reported. Notably, Samsung made a press release in 2017 following a total product recall of their Galaxy Note 7 mobile phone, confirming speculation that the events were attributable to the battery and its mode of manufacture. Recent incidences of battery swelling on the new iPhone 8 have been reported in the media, and the techniques and lessons reported herein may have future relevance. Here we look deeper into the key components of one of these cells and confirm evidence of cracking of electrode material in tightly folded areas, combined with a delamination of surface coating on the separator, which itself is an unusually thin monolayer. We report microstructural information about the electrodes, battery welding attributes, and thermal mapping of the battery whilst operational. The findings present a deeper insight into the battery’s component microstructures than previously disseminated. This points to the most probable combination of events and highlights the impact of design features, whilst providing structural considerations most likely to have led to the reported incidences relating to this phone.

Performance Comparison of Rechargeable Batteries for Stationary Applications (Ni/MH vs. Ni–Cd and VRLA),"Michael A. Zelinsky, John M.

A large percentage of telecom powerplants are housed in outdoor enclosures where valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries are commonly used because of their low-maintenance design. Batteries in these enclosures can be exposed to temperatures which can exceed 70 °C, significantly reducing battery life. Nickel–cadmium (Ni–Cd) batteries have traditionally been deployed in hotter locations as a high-temperature alternative to VRLA. This paper compares the performances of nickel/metal hydride (Ni/MH), Ni–Cd, and VRLA batteries in a simulated telecom environment according to published testing standards. Among these three choices, Ni/MH batteries showed the best overall performance, suggesting substantially longer operating life in high temperature stationary use. Full article"
Development of an Electro-Thermal Model for Electric Vehicles Using a Design of Experiments Approach,"Manoj Mathew, Mehrdad Mastali, John Catton, Ehsan Samadani, Stefan Janhunen, Michael Fowler",2018,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries4020029,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/2/29/pdf?version=1529317977,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/2/29,17,"An accurate and computationally efficient lithium-ion battery model is beneficial when developing state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) algorithms for battery management systems (BMS). These models allow for software-in-the-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, where the battery pack is simulated in software. However, development of these battery models can be time-consuming, especially when trying to model the effects of temperature and SOC on the equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters. Estimation of this relationship is often accomplished by carrying out many experiments, which can be costly and time consuming for BMS manufacturers. To address these issues, this paper makes two contributions to literature. First, a comprehensive battery model is developed, where the ECM parameter surface is generated using a design of experiments (DOE) approach. Second, replication runs are conducted to accurately estimate the measurement noise and determine which model parameters are significant. The technique is then compared with existing approaches from the literature, and it is shown that, by using the proposed method, the same degree of accuracy can be obtained while requiring significantly fewer experimental runs. This can be advantageous for BMS manufacturers that require a high-fidelity model but cannot afford to carry out many experiments. Full article"

Here, we investigate the ionic conductivity and how this property is influenced by segmental mobility and conducting ion number in crosslinked single-ion conducting polyether-based electrolytes with varying tethered anion and counter-cation types. Crosslinked electrolytes are prepared by the polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate, and ionic monomers. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes is measured and interpreted in the context of differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy measurements. A lithiated crosslinked electrolyte prepared with PEG 31 DA and (4-styrenesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (STFSI) monomers is found to have a lithium ion conductivity of 3.2 × 10 −6 and 1.8 × 10 −5 S/cm at 55 and 100 °C, respectively. The percentage of unpaired anions for this electrolyte was estimated at about 23% via Raman spectroscopy. Despite the large variances in metal cation–STFSI binding energies as predicted via density functional theory (DFT) and large variations in ionic conductivity, STFSI-based crosslinked electrolytes with the same charge density and varying cations (Li, Na, K, Mg, and Ca) were estimated to all have unpaired anion populations in the range of 19 to 29%.

EVs attract buyers with benefits including energy efficiency and environmental friendliness. As EV usage grows, more public spaces are installing EV charging stations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of EV charging station usage at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, Georgia. Three ChargePoint EV charging stations at UGA were used to collect data about each of 3204 charging events that occurred from 10 April 2014 to 20 June 2017. The charging event data included start date, start time, length of parking time, length of charging time, amount of energy delivered, and the postal code entered by the user during ChargePoint account registration. Analytical methods were proposed to obtain information about EV charging behavior, charging station occupancy, and geolocation of charging station users. The methodology presented here was time- and cost-effective, as well as scalable to other organizations that own charging stations. Because this study took place at a university, the results presented here can be used as a reference for EV charging station usage in other college towns in the USA that do not have EV charging stations but are planning to develop EV infrastructure.

In this study, we synthesized LLZT with a tantalum (Ta) content of 0.45 via a conventional solid-state reaction process and constructed a Li/LLZT/Li symmetric cell by attaching Li metal foils on the polished top and bottom surfaces of an LLZT pellet. We investigated the influence of heating temperatures and times on the interfacial charge-transfer resistance between LLZT and the Li metal electrode. In addition, the effect of the interface resistance on the stability for Li deposition and dissolution was examined using a galvanostatic cycling test. The lowest interfacial resistance of 25 Ω cm 2 at room temperature was obtained by heating at 175 °C (5 °C lower than the melting point of Li) for three to five hours. We confirmed that the current density at which the short circuit occurs in the Li/LLZT/Li cell via the propagation of Li dendrite into LLZT increases with decreasing interfacial charge transfer resistance.

For this, operando XAS was carried out during the first one and a half cycles, and the whole set of measured data was analysed using a statistical-chemometric approach, while low temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements were carried out ex situ on selected samples stopped at different points of the electrochemical reaction. Complementary ab initio calculations were performed to support the experimental findings. Both techniques show that, upon the first sodiation, most Sb reacts with Na to form disordered Na 3 3 Sb. This step is accompanied by the formation of amorphous Sb as an intermediate. Upon inversion of the current Na 3 3 Sb is desodiated and an amorphous Sb phase, distinct from the pristine bulk Sb state, is gradually formed. However, both XAS and Mössbauer spectroscopy were unable to spot the formation of intermediate Na x x Sb phases, which were evinced in previous works by operando Pair Distribution Function analyses. The results shown here clearly assign such failure to the intrinsic inability of both techniques to identify these intermediates. Full article"

Here, we report a facile and environmentally friendly method yielding uniformly dispersed ZnO particles with a controllable particle size between 5 and 80 nm, supported by exfoliated graphite (EG) sheets. A thermal post-treatment (420 to 800 °C, N 2 ) of ZnO@EG composite results in high yield with the opportunity for industrial scale-up. The post-treatment leads to growing ZnO particles on the EG sheets, while oxygen is disincorporated from ZnO by the associated carbothermal reduction of ZnO@EG composites above 600 °C and the conductivity is increased. ZnO@EG composite anodes, reduced at 600 °C, show improved Li storage capacity (+25%) and good cycle stability, compared to the EG anode. This can be attributed to the increased conductivity, despite the particle size increased up to 80 nm. Furthermore, we suggest that the mechanism for the reaction of Li + ions with ZnO@EG-composites including ZnO-particles with an average particle size below 20 nm differs from the classical Li + ions insertion/de-insertion or alloying process.

In abuse operating conditions, the rapid increase of temperature and pressure can cause the appearance of hot-spots, which may lead to an increasing degradation rate or even to the battery’s explosion and/or combustion. A sensing network of fiber Bragg gratings is attached to the surface of a prismatic LiB to monitor its temperature and bi-directional strain variations through normal charge (0.70 C) and two different discharge rates (1.32 C and 5.77 C) in the x - and y -directions. More significant variations are registered when the LiB operates in abnormal conditions. A maximum temperature variation of 27.52 ± 0.13 °C is detected by the sensors located close to the positive electrode side. Regarding strain and consequent length variations, maximum values of 593.58 ± 0.01 µε and 51.05 ± 0.05 µm are respectively obtained by the sensors placed on the y -direction. The sensing network presented can be a solution for the real-time monitoring, multipoint and in operando temperature and bi-directional strain variations in the LiBs, promoting their safety.

In this paper, some other often-neglected “trivial” parameters (including assembly pressure of the coil cells, thickness of spring/lithium foil in coin cells, sheet number of separator, and cut-off voltage) of Li–S batteries have been demonstrated to show pronounced effects on the battery performance. Our results indicate that the coin cell assembly pressure and sheet number of the separator play the important roles in suppressing polysulfide shuttling over battery cycling, which improves significantly the cycling life of Li–S batteries. The thickness of springs/lithium foils also affects the battery performance greatly. When switching the cut-off voltage of 1.5–3.0 V to narrower ones (1.7–2.5 V or 1.8–2.6 V), the cycling life of batteries at 0.2 C can be further enhanced to >300 cycles while with no drastic polysulfide shuttling. Adjusting these trivial parameters can thus synergistically improve the cycling performance of Li–S batteries. Full article"

On the other hand, fast capacity fade occurs in LiMn 2 O 4 mainly because of the induced manganese dissolution and formation of additional phases. Confocal Raman microscopy provides many opportunities for sensitive and spatially resolved structural studies of micro- and nanoscale phenomena. Here, we demonstrate advantages of confocal Raman spectroscopy approach for uncovering the mechanisms of lithiation/delithiation and degradation in LiMn 2 O 4 commercial cathodes. The analysis of Raman spectra for inspecting local lithiation state and phase composition is proposed and exploited for the visualization of the inhomogeneous distribution of lithium ions. The cycling of cathodes is shown to be followed by the formation and dissolution of the Mn 3 O 4 phase and local disturbance of the lithiation state. These processes are believed to be responsible for the capacity fade in the commercial batteries. Full article"

Lithium ion batteries are extensively employed for various applications owing to their low memory effect, high specific energy, and power density. One of the problems in the expansion of hybrid and electric vehicle technology is the management and control of operation temperatures and heat generation. Successful battery thermal management designs can lead to better reliability and performance of hybrid and electric vehicles. Thermal cycling and temperature gradients could have a considerable impact on the lifetime of lithium ion battery cells. Thermal management is critical in electric vehicles (EVs) and good thermal battery models are necessary to design proper heating and cooling systems. Consequently, it is necessary to determine thermal parameters of a single cell, such as internal resistance, specific heat capacity, entropic heat coefficient, and thermal conductivity in order to design suitable thermal management system.

Also, the state-of-charge of any rechargeable battery, regardless of its chemistry, is an essential condition parameter for battery management systems of hybrid electric vehicles. In this study, we share from our accumulated experience in the control system applications field some preliminary results, especially in modeling, control and state estimation techniques. We investigate the design and effectiveness of two state-of-charge estimators, namely an extended Kalman filter and a proportional integral observer, implemented in a real-time MATLAB environment for a particular Li-Ion battery. Definitely, the aim of this work is to find the most suitable estimator in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness to changes in initial conditions (i.e., the initial guess value of battery state-of-charge) and changes in process and measurement noise levels. By a rigorous performance analysis of MATLAB simulation results, the potential estimator choice is revealed. The performance comparison can be done visually on similar graphs if the information gathered provides a good insight, otherwise, it can be done statistically based on the calculus of statistic errors, in terms of root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean square error.

The proposed method is simple and requires limited equipment. Furthermore, electrical performance is significantly better and the cell capacity and resistance can be recorded for longer durations when compared to some of the previously used methods. Electrical performance of this new third electrode method is characterized and compared to 18650 cells with no reference electrode inserted. The capacity retention of the modified cell is more than 98% in the first 20 cycles. Harvested electrodes from a disassembled cell were also used to make coin cells that was proven to be a rather critical approach to get electrode potentials and capacities. This is an initial study that shows three-electrode performances of a commercial 18650-type cell, which suggests it could be used for understanding electrode behavior throughout a cell lifetime and for manufacturing instrumented cells.

Flexible and Lightweight Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on Cellulose Nanofibrils and Carbon Fibers,"Huiran Lu, Johan Hagberg, Göran Lindbergh, Ann Cornell",2018,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries4020017,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/2/17/pdf?version=1525346668,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/2/17,14,"Flexible, low-weight electrodes with integrated current collectors based on chopped polyacrylonitrile carbon fibers (CF) were produced using an easy, aqueous fabrication process, where only 4 wt% of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were used as the binder. A flexible full cell was assembled based on a LiFePO 4 (LFP) positive electrode with a CF current collector and a current collector-free CF negative electrode. The cell exhibited a stable specific capacity of 121 mAh g −1 based on the LFP weight. The CF in the negative electrode acted simultaneously as active material and current collector, which has a significant positive impact on energy density. Stable specific capacities of the CF/CNF negative electrode of 267 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C and 150 mAh g −1 at 1 C are demonstrated. The LFP/CNF with CF/CNF, as the current collector positive electrode (LFP-CF), exhibited a good rate performance with a capacity of ~150 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C and 133 mAh g −1 at 1 C. The polarization of the LFP-CF electrode was similar to that of a commercial Quallion LFP electrode, while much lower compared to a flexible LFP/CNF electrode with Al foil as the current collector. This is ascribed to good contact between the CF and the active material. Full article"

The United Nations have published a draft global technical regulation on electric vehicle safety (GTR EVS) describing a safety feature to warn passengers in case of a thermal runaway. Fast and reliable detection of faulty cells undergoing thermal runaway within the lithium-ion battery is therefore a key factor in battery designs for comprehensive passenger safety. A set of various possible sensors has been chosen based on the determined cell thermal runaway impact. These sensors have been tested in different sized battery setups and compared with respect to their ability of fast and reliable thermal runaway detection and their feasibility for traction batteries.

Prognosis and Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Lithium-Ion Battery with Optimal Multi-Level Particle Filter and Genetic Algorithm,Chinedu I.

The implementation of the traditional multi-level particle filter (TRMPF) has improved prognosis when compared with the one-step traditional particle filter that depended on the first-order state equation. However, despite this improvement, the need to enhance the accuracy of fault prognosis, diagnosis and detection cannot be overemphasized. To this end, an optimal multi-level particle filter (OPMPF) algorithm that combines genetic algorithm (GA) optimization and multi-level particle filter (MPF) techniques is used to predict the RUL of the C&S in order to enhance the accuracy of the estimation at different forms of deterioration in operation. A 9-fold cross-validation ensemble MPF that utilized lithium-ion (Li + ) batteries’ charge capacity decay to test the developed OPMPF algorithm showed an improvement of over 200% in the estimated RUL when compared with the TRMPF estimation.

We load the biocatalyst Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in predefined areas that form the MFCs, and freeze-dry them for long-term storage. The biobattery stack generates a maximum power and current of 20 μW and 25 μA, respectively, via microbial metabolism when the freeze-dried cells are rehydrated with readily available wastewater.

An attempt is made to separate effects simply caused by enlarged electrochemically active surface area and true (specific) electrocatalytic activity. Because this requires proper definition of the experimental setup and careful examination of experimental results, electrochemical methods employed in the reviewed studies are described first.

Modified (with additives) alkaline electrolyte has been one of the most investigated options to reduce the high solubility of zinc. However, this strategy alone has not been fully successful in enhancing the cycle life of the battery. The combination of mitigation strategies into one joint approach, by using additives (ZnO, KF, K 2 CO 3 ) in the base alkaline electrolyte and simultaneously preparing zinc electrodes that are based on ionomer (Nafion ® )-coated zinc particles, was implemented and evaluated. The joint use of electrolyte additives and ionomer coating was intended to regulate the exposition of Zn, deal with zincate solubility, minimize the shape change and dendrite formation, as well as reduce the hydrogen evolution rate. This strategy provided a beneficial joint protective efficiency of 87% thanks to decreasing the corrosion rate from 10.4 (blank) to 1.3 mg Zn cm −1 ·s −1 for coated Zn in the modified electrolyte. Although the rate capability and capacity are limited, the ionomer-coated Zn particles extended the ZAB cycle life by about 50%, providing battery roundtrip efficiency above 55% after 270 h operation.

An evaluation of eight commercially available, circuit protected, 18650 form factor Li-ion cells were performed, with analysis focusing on a residential consumer evaluation of performance. As typical consumer cell usage occurs at a relatively low discharge rate, cells were evaluated between 4.2 V and 2.7 V at C/10, C/5, and C/2 discharge rates. The evaluated cells ranged from “high-cost” Panasonic, Hixon, Orbtronic, and EastValley cells to “low-cost” UltraFire (UF) and Eilong cells. Initial discharge comparisons revealed that no cells delivered their nameplate capacity, with a large overstatement of cell capacity occurring for low-cost cells. On average, high-cost cells delivered 92.5% of their advertised capacity, with low-cost cells delivering 20.6% at a C/10 rate. Basing consumer evaluation on a cost per unit capacity and/or cost per unit energy, even with this large overstatement in capacity, low-cost cells still offer an advantage over higher-cost alternatives. The average cost per amp-hour for each cell group ranged from $1.65 to $3.38 for the low-cost and high-cost cell groupings, respectively. Analysis of voltage profiles highlighted two chemistries used in cell production, coinciding with each cell grouping. Full article"

Due to their aqueous electrolyte, they are inherently safe concerning flammability and environmentally friendly. In this work, the strong influence of the particle size of manganese sesquioxide on the performance of the battery is investigated. Ball milling was used to decrease the particle diameter. The resulting powders were used as active material for the cathodes, which were assembled in coin cells as full cells together with zinc foil anodes and aqueous electrolyte. It was shown that about one third of the original particle size can nearly triple the initial capacity when charged with constant current and constant end-of-charge voltage. Additionally, smaller particles were found to be responsible for the collapse of capacity at high current densities. By means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, it was shown that particle size also has a large impact on the internal resistance. Initially, the internal resistance of the cells with small particles was about half that of those with big particles, but became larger during cycling. This reveals accelerated aging processes when the reactive surface of the active material is increased by smaller particles. Full article"

Thus, a proper characterization of Li-ion cells is required to optimize their use and their manufacturing process. In this study, the transport phenomena and electrochemical processes taking place in LiCoO 2 -Li(NiMnCo)O 2 /graphite (LCO-NMC/graphite) cells are identified from half-cell measurements by means of impedance spectroscopy. The results are calculated from current densities, instead of absolute values, for the future comparison of this data with other cells. In particular, impedance spectra are fitted to simple electrical models composed of an inductive part, serial resistance, and various RQ networks—the parallel combination of a resistor and a constant phase element—depending on the cell. Thus, the evolution of resistances, capacitances, and the characteristic frequencies of the various effects are tracked with the state-of-charge (SoC) at two aging levels. Concretely, two effects are identified at the impedance spectrum; one is clearly caused by the charge transfer at the positive electrode, whereas the other one is presumably caused by the transport of lithium ions across the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Moreover, as the cells age, the characteristic frequency of the charge transfer is drastically reduced by a factor of around 70%. Full article"

This chemical method has the ability to remove the oxidation on nickel nano-particle surfaces during ink fabrication; the nickel ions, which are produced during chemical etching, will be reduced and bridged among original nano-nickel particles in the following thermal sintering process at 350 °C. X-ray diffraction results exhibit that the final nickel film has no significant composition change by this chemical method and that oxidation has been effectively removed. Scanning electron microscopy images show that this chemical process reduces nickel oxides into nickel and that the reduced nickel sticks on the original nickel particle surface acting as a “bridge” connecting each particle. So solid diffusion can be triggered easily among bridged nickel particles and sintered at relatively low temperatures. The resistivity of printed film is to 5 × 10 − 6 Ω 5 × 10 − 6 Ω ∙m which is 71-times that of bulk nickel. The fabricated conductive nickel thin film has been applied on lithium ion batteries as a current collector for cathode and anode and shows good corrosion resistance and stability. Full article"

Glycerol exhibits a number of features (e.g., glass-forming behavior, low glass transition temperature, high flexibility of the backbone, and efficient coordination of lithium ions) that make it an appealing ion-conducting medium and a challenging building block in the preparation of new inorganic–organic polymer electrolytes. This work reports the preparation and the extensive investigation of a family of 11 electrolytes based on lithium glycerolate. The electrolytes have the formula C 3 H 5 (OH) 3−x (OLi) x , where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The elemental composition is evaluated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The structure and interactions are studied by vibrational spectroscopies (FT-IR and micro-Raman). The thermal properties are gauged by modulated differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Finally, insights on the long-range charge migration mechanism and glycerol relaxation events are investigated via broadband electrical spectroscopy. Results show that in these electrolytes, glycerolate acts as a large and flexible macro-anion, bestowing to the material single-ion conductivity (1.99 × 10 −4 at 30 °C and 1.55 × 10 −2 S∙cm −1 at 150 °C for x = 0.250).

The viscosity of solutions containing 0.01 M VOSO 4 in 0.1–7.0 M H 2 SO 4 was measured. Diffusion coefficients were independently measured via electrochemical methods and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with excellent agreement between the techniques employed and literature values. Analysis of cyclic voltammograms suggest the oxidation of VO 2+ to VO 2 + is quasi-reversible at high H 2 SO 4 concentrations (>5 mol/L), and approaching irreversible at lower H 2 SO 4 concentrations. Further analysis reveals a likely electrochemical/chemical (EC) mechanism where the H 2 SO 4 facilitates the electrochemical step but hinders the chemical step. Fundamental insights of VO 2+ /H 2 SO 4 solutions can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the concentration effects in electrolyte solutions. Full article"

The understanding of the effects that alternating currents have on batteries requires specific characterization methods and accurate measurement equipment. The lack of commercial battery testers with high alternating current capability simultaneously to the ability of operating at frequencies above 200 Hz, led to the design of the presented experimental setup. Additionally, the experimental setup expands the state-of-the-art of lithium-ion batteries testers by incorporating relevant lithium-ion battery cell characterization routines, namely hybrid pulse power current, incremental capacity analysis and galvanic intermittent titration technique. In this paper the hardware and the measurement capabilities of the experimental setup are presented. Moreover, the measurements errors due to the setup’s instruments were analysed to ensure lithium-ion batteries cell characterization quality. Finally, this paper presents preliminary results of capacity fade tests where 28 Ah cells were cycled with and without the injection of 21 A alternating at 1 kHz. Up to 300 cycles, no significant fade in cell capacity may be measured, meaning that alternating currents may not be as harmful for lithium-ion batteries as considered so far. Full article"

One promising cell technology to fulfill the increasing requirements for actual and future applications are all solid-state batteries with pure lithium metal on the anode side. The outstanding electrochemical material advantages of lithium, with its high theoretical capacity of 3860 mAh/g and low density of 0.534 g/cm 3 , can only be taken advantage of in all solid-state batteries, since, in conventional liquid electrochemical systems, the lithium dissolves with each discharging cycle. Apart from the current low stability of all solid-state separators, challenges lie in the general processing, as well as the handling and separation, of lithium metal foils. Unfortunately, lithium metal anodes cannot be separated by conventional die cutting processes in large quantities. Due to its adhesive properties and toughness, mechanical cutting tools require intensive cleaning after each cut. The presented experiments show that remote laser cutting, as a contactless and wear-free method, has the potential to separate anodes in large numbers with high-quality cutting edges. Full article"

In a recent publication, we pointed out a conflict in binding energy (BE) scale referencing at alkali metal samples, which is manifested in systematic deviations of the BEs up to several eV due to a specific interaction between the highly reactive alkali metal in contact with non-conducting surrounding species. The consequences of this phenomenon for XPS data interpretation are discussed in the present manuscript. Investigations of phenomena at surface-electrolyte interphase regions for a wide range of materials for both lithium and sodium-based applications are explained, ranging from oxide-based cathode materials via alloys and carbon-based anodes including appropriate reference chemicals. Depending on material class and alkaline content, specific solutions are proposed for choosing the correct reference BE to accurately define the BE scale. In conclusion, the different approaches for the use of reference elements, such as aliphatic carbon, implanted noble gas or surface metals, partially lack practicability and can lead to misinterpretation for application in battery materials. Thus, this manuscript provides exemplary alternative solutions. Full article"

It is found that the kinetics of the self-discharge of supercapacitors comprises at least two characteristic time constants in the range of days and months. The curvature of the Nyquist curve at frequencies above 10 Hz (charge transfer resistance) depends on the available electric charge as well, but it is of little use for applications.

Unlike conventional fuel cells that are based on stable chemical reactions, these BESs are sensitive to environmental and operating conditions, such as temperature, pH, external resistance, etc. Substrate type, electrode material, and reactor configuration are also important factors affecting power generation in MFCs and hydrogen production in MECs. In order to discuss the influence of these above factors on the performance of MFCs and MECs, this study analyzes published data via data synthesis and meta-analysis. The results revealed that domestic wastewater would be more suitable for treatment using MFCs or MECs, due to their lower toxicity for anode biofilms compared to swine wastewater and landfill leachate. The optimal temperature was 25–35 °C, optimal pH was 6–7, and optimal external resistance was 100–1000 Ω. Although systems using carbon cloth as the electrodes demonstrated better performance (due to carbon cloth’s large surface area for microbial growth), the high prices of this material and other existing carbonaceous materials make it inappropriate for practical applications. To scale up and commercialize MFCs and MECs in the future, enhanced system performance and stability are needed, and could be possibly achieved with improved system designs. Full article"

It has been shown that no noticeable substitution of the V 3+ ions by the La 3+ ions occurs in the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3 structure under the synthesis conditions; meanwhile, the introduction of the La 3+ ions into the reagent mixture leads to the formation of the LaPO 4 phase, and accordingly, an increase in the NaF/VPO 4 ratio. The latter results in the formation of the Na 3 PO 4 and Na 3 VF 6 surface impurity phases, which possess high ionic and electronic conductivity, respectively, and significantly enhances the electrical conductivity and the cycling performance of the composite cathode material both in Na and Li cells, while simple surface modification of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3 by LaPO 4 via precipitation does not.

Comparison of Battery Architecture Dependability,"Christophe Savard, Pascal Venet, Éric Niel, Laurent Piétrac, Ali Sari",2018,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries4030031,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/3/31/pdf?version=1530619887,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/3/31,5,"This paper presents various solutions for organizing an accumulator battery. It examines three different architectures: series-parallel, parallel-series and C3C architecture, which spread the cell output current flux to three other cells. Alternatively, to improve a several cell system reliability, it is possible to insert more cells than necessary and soliciting them less. Classical RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety) solutions can be deployed by adding redundant cells or by tolerating some cell failures. With more cells than necessary, it is also possible to choose active cells by a selection algorithm and place the others at rest. Each variant is simulated for the three architectures in order to determine the impact on battery-operative dependability, that is to say the duration of how long the battery complies specifications. To justify that the conventional RAMS solutions are not deployed to date, this article examines the influence on operative dependability. If the conventional variants allow to extend the moment before the battery stops to be operational, using an algorithm with a suitable optimization criterion further extend the battery mission time.

Application of Robust Design Methodology to Battery Packs for Electric Vehicles: Identification of Critical Technical Requirements for Modular Architecture,"Shashank Arora, Ajay Kapoor, Weixiang Shen",2018,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries4030030,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/3/30/pdf?version=1530512737,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/4/3/30,40,"Modularity-in-design of battery packs for electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial to offset their high manufacturing cost. However, inconsistencies in performance of EV battery packs can be introduced by various sources. Sources of variation affect their robustness. In this paper, parameter diagram, a value-based conceptual analysis approach, is applied to analyze these variations. Their interaction with customer requirements, i.e., ideal system output, are examined and critical engineering features for designing modular battery packs for EV applications are determined. Consequently, sources of variability, which have a detrimental effect on mass-producibility of EV battery packs, are identified and differentiated from the set of control factors. Theoretically, appropriate control level settings can minimize sensitivity of EV battery packs to the sources of variability. In view of this, strength of the relationship between ideal system response and various control factors is studied using a “house of quality” diagram. It is found that battery thermal management system and packaging architecture are the two most influential parameters having the largest effect on reliability of EV battery packs. More importantly, it is noted that heat transfer between adjacent battery modules cannot be eliminated. For successful implementation of modular architecture, it is, therefore, essential that mechanical modularity must be enabled via thermal modularity of EV battery packs. Full article"
Combining a Fatigue Model and an Incremental Capacity Analysis on a Commercial NMC/Graphite Cell under Constant Current Cycling with and without Calendar Aging,"Tiphaine Plattard, Nathalie Barnel, Loïc Assaud, Sylvain Franger, Jean-Marc Duffault",2019,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries5010036,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/1/36/pdf?version=1553683567,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/1/36,32,"Reliable development of LIBs requires that they be correlated with accurate aging studies. The present project focuses on the implementation of a weighted ampere-hour throughput model, taking into account the operating parameters, and modulating the impact of an exchanged ampere-hour by the well-established three major stress factors: temperature, current intensity (rated), and state of charge (SoC). This model can drift with time due to repeated solicitation, so its parameters need to be updated by on-field measurements, in order to remain accurate. These on-field measurements are submitted to the so-called Incremental Capacity Analysis method (ICA), consisting in the analysis of d Q /d V as a function of V . It is a direct indicator of the state of health of the cell, as the experimental peaks are related to the active material chemical/structural evolution, such as phase transitions and recorded potential plateaus during charging/discharging. It is here applied to NMC/graphite based commercial cells. These peaks’ evolution can be correlated with the here-defined Ah-kinetic and t √ t -kinetic aging, which are chemistry-dependent, and therefore, has to be adjusted to the different types of cells.

Thermodynamic data are evaluated for vacuum and Ar atmosphere reduction reactions and results for Zn reduction/evaporation are compared via the FactSage program. Zn vapor and manganese oxide were obtained as products. Zn vapor was re-oxidized in end products; manganese monoxide and steel container of batteries are evaluated as ferromanganese raw material.

Specific criteria dedicated to the second life are first discussed. After a short review of the available state of health indicators and their associated determination techniques, some electrical characterization tests are explored through an experimental campaign. This offline identification aims to estimate the remaining ability of the battery to store energy. Twenty-four modules from six different commercial electric vehicles are analyzed. Well-known methodologies like incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and constant voltage phase analysis during CC-CV charge highlight the difficulty—and sometimes the impossibility—to apply traditional tools on a battery pack or on individual modules, in the context of real second life applications. Indeed, the diversity of the available second life batteries induces a combination of aging mechanisms that leads to a complete heterogeneity from a cell to another. Moreover, due to the unknown first life of the battery, typical state of health determination methodologies are difficult to use. A new generic technique based on a partial coulometric counter is proposed and compared to other techniques. In the present case study, the partial coulometric counter allows a fast determination of the capacity aging. In conclusion, future improvements and working tracks are addressed. Full article"

Electrochemical investigations were carried out in half-cell configuration. The electrolyte was 6 M KOH in excess. Coated zinc particles provided a discharge capacity of 737 mAh g −1 (89.9% DoD) versus 633 mAh g −1 (77.2% DoD) of untreated zinc particles after a dwell time of 1 h in KOH. The silica coating reduced the direct contact of the zinc surface with the electrolyte and thus minimized the hydrogen evolution reaction, which led to an increased discharge capacity. Additionally, bismuth doping enhanced conductivity within the silica coating and increased zinc utilization. Those coated zinc particles inhibited corrosion, i.e., corrosion efficiency reached 87.9% compared to uncoated zinc. Additionally, the coating achieved a capacity retention of 90.9% (670 mAh g −1 ) after 48 h dwell time in 6 M KOH. The coatings were prepared by sol-gel technology and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface determination.

In addition to well-known core gratings, embedded into the anode of 5 Ah lithium ion pouch cells as a strain monitoring unit, the manufacturing of a surface cladding waveguide Bragg grating sensor incorporated into the cell’s separator, that is sensitive to changes of the refractive index of the surrounding medium, is demonstrated. On the basis of the experiments carried out, characteristics of the cell behavior during standard cyclization and recognizable marks in subsequent post-mortem analyses of the cell components are shown. No negative influence on the cell performance due to the integrated sensors have been observed; however, the results show a clear correlation between fading cell capacity and changes of the interior optical signals. Additionally, with the novel photonic sensor, variations in the electrolyte characteristics are determinable as the refractive index of the solution changes at different molar compositions. Furthermore, with the manufactured battery cells, abuse tests by overcharging were conducted, and it was thereby demonstrated how internal battery sensors can derive additional information beyond conventional battery management systems to feasibly prevent catastrophic cell failures. The result of the research work is an early stage photonic sensor that combines chemical, mechanical and thermal information from inside the cell for an enhanced battery status analysis.

To ensure operation for a substantial period, for applications with difficult physical access, a means of storing electrical energy must be included in the system. The battery remains the most deployed solution. Lead-acid batteries still have a significant share of this market due to the maturity of their technology. However, even by sizing all the system elements according to the needs and the available renewable energy, some failure occurs. The battery is the weak element. It can be quickly discharged when the renewable energy source is no longer present for a while. It can also be overloaded or subjected to high temperatures, which affects its longevity. This paper presents a suggested improvement for these systems, systematically adding extra devices to reduce excess charges and heat and allowing the battery use at lower charges. The interest of this strategy is presented by comparing the number of days of system failure and the consequences for battery aging. To demonstrate the interest of the proposed improvement track, a colored Petri net is deployed to model the battery degradation parameters evolution, in order to compare them. Full article"

This paper presents the results of accelerated aging tests applied on 12 samples of LiCs. Two high temperatures (60 °C and 70 °C) and two voltage values were used for aging acceleration for 20 months. The maximum and the minimum voltages (3.8 V and 2.2 V respectively) had different effects on capacitance fade. Cells aging at 2.2 V encountered extreme decrease of the capacitance. After storing them for only one month at 60 °C, they lost around 22% of their initial capacitance. For this reason, an aging model was developed for cells aging at the lowest voltage value to emphasize the huge decrease of the lifetime at this voltage condition. Moreover, two measurement tools of the capacitance were compared to find the optimal method for following the evolution of the aging process. It was proved that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is the most accurate measurement technique that can reveal the actual level of degradation inside a LiC cell. Full article"

However, pores in silicon particles are easily occupied by carbon during the preparation of silicon/carbon composites. In this paper, sulfur was adsorbed in the pores of porous silicon particles before polyaniline (PANI) coating by in-situ polymerization, so that the pores were preserved in porous silicon@carbon ( p -Si/@C) composites after the sublimation of sulfur during carbonization. The microstructure and the electrochemical performances of the obtained p -Si/@C composites were investigated. The results indicate that p -Si/@C composites prepared with a sulfur-melting process show a better high-rate performance than those without a sulfur-melting process.

The influence of alumina and LiClO 4 addition are investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to study the thermal behavior of salt-free and salt-containing samples and to identify the melting temperature. Dynamic mechanical analysis reveals the elastic properties as a function of temperature. Electrochemical properties are investigated using impedance spectroscopy. It is found that addition of alumina increases mechanical strength, while LiClO 4 decreases it. Addition of LiClO 4 and Al 2 O 3 increases ionic conductivity and improves mechanical properties.

To facilitate system-level analysis, we have developed a one-dimensional RFB stack model through the combination of a one-dimensional Newman-type cell model and a resistor-network to evaluate contributions from shunt currents within the stack. Inclusion of hydraulic losses and membrane crossover enables constrained optimization of system performance and allows users to make recommendations for operating flow rate, current densities, and cell design given a subset of electrolyte and electrode properties. Over the range of experimental conditions explored, shunt current losses remain small, but mass-transfer losses quickly become prohibitive at high current densities. Attempting to offset mass-transfer losses with high flow rates reduces system efficiency due to the increase in pressure drop through the porous electrode. The development of this stack model application, along with the availability of the source MATLAB code, allows for facile approximation of the upper limits of performance with limited empiricism. This work primarily presents a readily adaptable tool to enable researchers to perform either front-end performance estimates based on fundamental material properties or to benchmark their experimental results.

Nevertheless, with technology advances and the growth of the market, the price of the battery is getting more competitive. The greenhouse gas emissions and the battery cost have been studied previously, but coherent boundaries between environmental and economic assessments are needed to assess the eco-efficiency of batteries. In this research, a detailed study is presented, providing an environmental and economic assessment of the manufacturing of one specific lithium-ion battery chemistry. The relevance of parameters is pointed out, including the manufacturing place, the production volume, the commodity prices, and the energy density. The inventory is obtained by dismantling commercial cells. The correlation between the battery cost and the commodity price is much lower than the correlation between the battery cost and the production volume. The developed life cycle assessment concludes that the electricity mix that is used to power the battery factory is a key parameter for the impact of the battery manufacturing on climate change. To improve the battery manufacturing eco-efficiency, a high production capacity and an electricity mix with low carbon intensity are suggested. Optimizing the process by reducing the electricity consumption during the manufacturing is also suggested, and combined with higher pack energy density, the impact on climate change of the pack manufacturing is as low as 39.5 kg CO 2 eq/kWh.

This research paper addresses the environmental effects of two different types of batteries, lithium-ion (LiIo) and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, in terms of their chemical constituents. Life cycle impact analysis has been carried out by the CML, ReCiPe, EcoPoints 97, IPCC, and CED methods. The impacts are considered in categories such as global warming, eutrophication, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, human toxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity. The results reveal that there is a significant environmental impact caused by nickel-metal hydride batteries in comparison with lithium-ion batteries. The reason behind these impacts is the relatively large amount of toxic chemical elements which are present as constituents of NiMH batteries. It can be anticipated that a better environmental performance can be achieved through optimization, especially by cautiously picking the constituents, taking into account the toxicity aspects, and by minimizing the impacts related to these chemicals.

The VRB has a deep discharging capability, long cycle life, and high energy efficiency with no issues of cell-balancing, which make it suitable for large-scale energy storage systems. The proposed approach determines the appropriate charging current and the optimal electrolyte flow rate based on the available time-varying input power. Moreover, the charging current is bounded by the limiting current, which prevents the gassing side-reactions and protects the VRB from overcharging.

However, due to the small areal capacity of nanometric thin films, the electrochemical activity of the cell casing must be negligible or at least well determined. We reported on the capacity and the differential capacity metrics of several materials used in the construction of the electrical terminals in LIBs. Among these materials, Ti was revealed to have the minimum reversible capacity for lithium-ion storage. The mechanical and electrochemical properties of the Ti–based materials were further improved through surface nitridation with thermal treatment in an ammonia-rich atmosphere. The nitridated Ti electrical terminal achieved a reversible capacity that was at least fifteen times lower than that of stainless steel, with a featureless differential capacity representation creating quasi-ideal experimental conditions for a detailed investigation of electroactive thin films.

Degradation Phenomena of Bismuth-Modified Felt Electrodes in VRFB Studied by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy,"Jonathan Schneider, Eduard Bulczak, Gumaa A.

These phenomena are especially severe at the negative side, where the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) will be increasingly favored over the reduction of V(III) with ongoing degradation of the carbon felt electrode. Bismuth, either added to the electrolyte or deposited onto the felt, has been reported to suppress the HER and therefore to enhance the kinetics of the V(II)/V(III) redox reaction. This study is the first to investigate degradation effects on bismuth-modified electrodes in the negative half-cell of a VRFB. By means of a simple impregnation method, a commercially available carbon felt was decorated with Bi 2 2 O 3 3 , which is supposedly present as Bi(0) under the working conditions at the negative side. Modified and unmodified felts were characterized electrochemically using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode setup. Surface morphology of the electrodes and composition of the negative half-cell electrolyte were probed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (TXRF), respectively. This was done before and after the electrodes were subjected to 50 charge-discharge cycles in a battery test bench. Our results suggest that not only the bismuth catalyst is dissolved from the electrode during battery operation, but also that the presence of bismuth in the system has a strong accelerating effect on electrode degradation.

The electrochemical properties of the CNT cathodes were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Palladium-filled cathodes displayed better performance as compared to the palladium-coated ones due to the shielding of the catalysts. The mechanism of the improvement was associated to the reduction of the rate of resistances growth in the batteries, especially the ionic resistances in the electrolyte and electrodes. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopy were used to analyze the products of the reaction that were adsorbed on the electrode surface of the battery, which was fabricated using palladium-coated and palladium-filled CNTs as cathodes and an ether-based electrolyte.

At this point, the battery is typically removed for recycling. This treatment of the electric vehicle battery is not efficient, as there is still a high enough storage capacity that they can be used in various non-vehicular uses. Unfortunately, there are numerous barriers limiting the adoption of re-used electric vehicle batteries. Herein, the authors analyze the limitations and current codes and standards that affect re-purposed battery pack designs. Utilizing these requirements, a bench test setup is designed and built, to determine feasibility of a repurposed electric vehicle (EV) battery for stationary energy storage in Canada. Full article"

These electrolyte solutions were investigated in terms of performance in vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). The half-wave potentials of the V(III)/V(II) and V(V)/V(IV) couples, determined by cyclic voltammetry, and the electronic spectra of V(III) and V(IV) electrolyte samples, are discussed to reveal the effect of electrolyte matrix on charge-discharge behavior of a 40 cm 2 cell operated with 1.6 M V 3.5+ electrolytes in sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. Provided that the total vanadium concentration and the conductivity of electrolytes are comparable for both acids, respective energy efficiencies of 77% and 72–75% were attained at a current density of 50 mA∙cm −2 . All electrolytes in the oxidation state V(V) were examined for chemical stability at room temperature and +45 °C by titrimetric determination of the molar ratio V(V):V(IV) and total vanadium concentration.

However, care needs to be taken to ensure the presence of the RE does not perturb the normal operation of the cell. Furthermore, if not properly controlled, geometrical and chemical features of the RE can have a significant influence on the measured response. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the range of RE types and configurations reported in the literature, with a focus on critical aspects such as electrochemical methods of analysis, cell geometry, and chemical composition of the RE and influence of the electrolyte. Some of the more controversial issues reported in the literature are highlighted and the benefits and drawbacks of the use of REs as an in situ diagnostic tool in LIBs are discussed. Full article"

The composites were prepared by dispersing Si nanoparticles in a phenolic resin as a carbon source, subsequent carbonization, and etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF). Special attention was paid to understanding the role of HF etching as post-treatment to provide additional void spaces in the composites. The etching process was shown to reduce the SiO 2 native layer on the Si nanoparticles, resulting in increased porosity in comparison to the non-etched composite material. For cell optimization, vinylene carbonate (VC) was employed as an electrolyte additive to build a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the electrode. The composition of the SEI layer on Si/MC electrodes, cycled with and without VC-containing electrolytes for several cycles, was then comprehensively investigated by using ex-situ XPS. The SEI layers on the electrodes working with VC-containing electrolyte were more stable than those in configurations without VC; this explains why our sample with VC exhibits lower irreversible capacity losses after several cycles. The optimized Si/MC composites exhibit a reversible capacity of ~800 mAhg −1 with an average coulombic efficiency of ~99 % over 400 cycles at C/10. Full article"
Exploring the Economic Potential of Sodium-Ion Batteries,"Jens F.

However, only one detailed study about material costs has yet been published for this battery type. This paper presents the first detailed economic assessment of 18,650-type SIB cells with a layered oxide cathode and a hard carbon anode, based on existing datasheets for pre-commercial battery cells. The results are compared with those of competing LIB cells, that is, with lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxide cathodes (NMC) and with lithium-iron-phosphate cathodes (LFP). A sensitivity analysis further evaluates the influence of varying raw material prices on the results. For the SIB, a cell price of 223 €/kWh is obtained, compared to 229 €/kWh for the LFP and 168 €/kWh for the NMC batteries. The main contributor to the price of the SIB cells are the material costs, above all the cathode and anode active materials. For this reason, the amount of cathode active material (e.g., coating thickness) in addition to potential fluctuations in the raw material prices have a considerable effect on the price per kWh of storage capacity. Regarding the anode, the precursor material costs have a significant influence on the hard carbon cost, and thus on the final price of the SIB cell. Organic wastes and fossil coke precursor materials have the potential of yielding hard carbon at very competitive costs. In addition, cost reductions in comparison with LIBs are achieved for the current collectors, since SIBs also allow the use of aluminum instead of copper on the anode side. For the electrolyte, the substitution of lithium with sodium leads to only a marginal cost decrease from 16.1 to 15.8 €/L, hardly noticeable in the final cell price. On the other hand, the achievable energy density is fundamental. While it seems difficult to achieve the same price per kWh as high energy density NMC LIBs, the SIB could be a promising substitute for LFP cells in stationary applications, if it also becomes competitive with LFP cells in terms of safety and cycle life.

The biobattery power output was maximized in real time by combining intermittent power generation with a Perturbation-and-Observation algorithm for maximum power point tracking. The proposed approach was validated by operating the biobattery under a broad range of environmental conditions affecting power production, such as temperature (4–25 °C), NaCl concentration (up to 2 g L −1 ), and carbon source concentration. Real-time biobattery performance diagnostics was achieved by estimating key internal parameters (resistance, capacitance, open circuit voltage) using an equivalent electrical circuit model. The real time optimization approach ensured maximum power production during 388 days of biobattery operation under varying environmental conditions, thus confirming the feasibility of biobattery application for powering small electronic devices in field applications.

This empirical study successfully tested the used modules in secondary grid applications in laboratory conditions. The selection of the secondary application was based on the construction features of the modules and the growing need for storage in grid operations. Description of the laboratory setup is provided in the context of a critical practical constraint where the battery management system and the usage and health history are not available to the secondary battery integrator. Charge and discharge profiles were developed based upon applications for peak shaving and firming renewables. Techno-economic analysis was focused on peak shaving at the utility level, considering a growing need for an affordable and environmentally friendly replacement to the traditional solutions based on environmentally costly peaker plants. The analysis showed strong evidence that near-term and future storage markets will be characterized by a large mismatch between the demand and supply of reused batteries from automotive primary applications for peak-shaving purposes in the generation side. The paper includes a discussion on successful adoption of cascaded use of batteries and their potential to reduce both economic and environmental cost of peak shaving. Full article"

The VPG membrane had an average pore size of 4 nm and porosity of ~28%. The VPG ion separator exhibited higher proton diffusivity but lower conductivity than the Nafion ® 117 membrane because the former is intrinsically nonionic. The VRFB equipped with the VPG ion separator (VPG-VRFB) exhibited much better stability during long-term cyclic operation than the VRFB equipped with the Nafion-117 membrane (Nafion-VRFB) because the ionic Nafion membrane could be contaminated by vanadium ions exchanged into the water channels. This increases its area specific resistance, while the VPG does not have ion exchange capacity and hence has less vanadium ion contamination. The VPG-VRFB was found to outperform the Nafion-VRFB in energy efficiency (EE) during long-term cyclic operation although the former underperformed the latter in the initial period of continued operation. The VPG ion separator also showed markedly better thermal stability and temperature tolerance than the Nafion membrane as indicated by the significantly smaller losses of EE and discharge capacity for the VPG-VRFB than for the Nafion-VRFB after operating at 45 °C. The outstanding temperature tolerance of the VPG ion separator is due primarily to its rigid and non-swelling pore structure and nonionic nature, which are highly resistant to thermal distortion and vanadium ion contamination. The excellent temperature tolerance of the VPG may be useful for applications where temperature control is difficult. Full article"

However, the vanadium crossover through the membrane causes a self-discharge, which results in a capacity shift towards one half cell. This leads to a gradual decrease in its efficiency over time. Capacity balancing methods for compensation of this effect require a reliable online state of charge (SoC) monitoring. Most common methods cannot provide exact values of the individual concentration of each species in both electrolytes. In particular, the state of the positive electrolyte cannot yet be precisely determined. In this work, an amperometric SoC monitoring is proposed as a new approach. First, the suitability of the principle is investigated with a rotating disc electrode (RDE). Then, a sensor based on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) is developed and tested in the positive electrolyte. The dependencies between oxidative current and V(IV)-concentration are examined as well as those between reduction current and V(V)-concentration. Using both relationships, a reliable measurement of all relevant concentrations is possible. Full article"

A majority of the current SOC estimation methods rely on data collected and calibrated offline, which could lead to inaccuracies in SOC estimation under different operating conditions or when the battery ages. This paper presents a novel real-time SOC estimation of a lithium-ion battery by applying the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to a detailed electrochemical model of a single cell. This work also optimizes both the single-cell model and PSO algorithm so that the developed algorithm can run on an embedded hardware with reasonable utilization of central processing unit (CPU) and memory resources while estimating the SOC with reasonable accuracy. A modular single-cell electrochemical model, as well as the proposed constrained PSO-based SOC estimation algorithm, was developed in Simulink©, and its performance was theoretically verified in simulation. Experimental data were collected for healthy and aged Li-ion battery cells in order to validate the proposed algorithm. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the developed algorithm is able to accurately estimate the battery SOC for 1C charge and 1C discharge operations for both healthy and aged cells.

In this study, the open circuit voltage immediately after the cessation of charge/discharge is used for the mapping of reactant conversion. This quantity is not hampered by lateral flow of current and can be conveniently transformed to the corresponding state of charge. The difference between theoretically calculated and experimentally determined conversion (change in the state of charge) across the electrode is used to determine local variations in conversion efficiency. The method is validated by systematic experiments using electrodes with different modifications, varying current densities and flow configurations. The procedure and the interpretation are simple and scalable to any size of flow cell. Full article"

At present, they are limited by low coulombic efficiency, low active material use, and poor rate capability. To overcome these challenges, two types of nanostructured doped iron materials were investigated: (1) copper and tin doped iron (CuSn); and (2) tin doped iron (Sn). Single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) was added to the electrode and LiOH to the electrolyte. In the 2 wt. % Cu + 2 wt. % Sn sample, the addition of SWCNT increased the discharge capacity from 430 to 475 mAh g −1 , and charge efficiency increased from 83% to 93.5%. With the addition of both SWCNT and LiOH, the charge efficiency and discharge capacity improved to 91% and 603 mAh g −1 , respectively. Meanwhile, the 4 wt. % Sn substituted sample performance is not on par with the 2 wt. % Cu + 2 wt. % Sn sample. The dopant elements (Cu and Sn) and additives (SWCNT and LiOH) have a major impact on the electrode performance. To understand the relation between hydrogen evolution and charge current density, we have used in operando charging measurements combined with mass spectrometry to quantify the evolved hydrogen. The electrodes that were subjected to prolonged overcharge upon hydrogen evolution failed rapidly. This insight could help in the development of better charging schemes for the iron electrodes.

The system includes DC/DC and DC/AC converters, as well as a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to maximize the harvested energy from PV array. The system advantages are represented to overcome the problem of each source when used individually and to optimize the hydrogen consumption.

In order to analyze and monitor the system, it was implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation done for fuzzy logic and high frequency decoupling and state machine control strategies to validate the PI classic control strategy. The obtained results confirmed that the system works efficiently as a microgrid system. The results show that the SOC for the battery is kept between 56 and 65.4%, which is considered a proper value for such types of batteries. The DC bus voltage (VDC) is kept within the acceptable level. Moreover, the H 2 fuel consumption is 12.1 gm, as the FCs are used as supported sources working with the PV. A big area for improvement is available for cost saving, which suggests the need for further research through system optimization and employing different control strategies. Full article"

The paper presents a strategic model parameterization procedure, parameter values, and a developed model that allows simulating electrochemical and thermal behavior of a commercial lithium-ion battery with high accuracy. Steps taken are the analysis of geometry details by opening a battery cell under argon atmosphere, building upon reference data of similar material compositions, incorporating cell balancing by a quasi-open-circuit-voltage experiment, and adapting the battery models reaction kinetics behavior by comparing experiment and simulation of an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and hybrid pulse power characterization. The electrochemical-thermal coupled model is established based on COMSOL Multiphysics ® platform (Stockholm, Sweden) and validated via experimental methods. The parameterized model was adopted to analyze the heat dissipation sources based on the internal states of the battery at different operation modes. Simulation in the field of thermal management for lithium-ion batteries highly depends on state of charge-related thermal issues of the incorporated cell composition. The electrode balancing is an essential step to be performed in order to address the internal battery states realistically. The individual contribution of the cell components heat dissipation has significant influence on the temperature distribution pattern based on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties. Full article"

This paper focuses on risks and hazards associated with venting of gaseous species formed by thermal decomposition reactions of the electrolyte and electrode materials during thermal runaway of the cell. A test set-up for qualitative and quantitative measurements of both major and minor gas species in the vented emissions from Li-ion batteries is described. The objective of the study is to measure gas emissions in the absence of flames, since gassing can occur without subsequent fire. Test results regarding gas emission rates, total gas emission volumes, and amounts of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and CO 2 formed in inert atmosphere when heating lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) dioxide/lithium manganese oxide (LMO) spinel cell stacks are presented and discussed. Important test findings include the large difference in total gas emissions from NMC/LMO cells compared to LFP, 780 L kg −1 battery cells, and 42 L kg −1 battery cells, respectively. However, there was no significant difference in the total amount of HF formed for both cell types, suggesting that LFP releases higher concentrations of HF than NMC/LMO cells. Full article"

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) due to their excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties seem like an ideal component to produce Cu-CNT composites of superior electrochemical performance. In this report we present whether Cu-CNT contact has a beneficial influence for manufacturing of a new type of carbon-based supercapacitor with embedded copper particles. The prepared electrode material was examined in symmetric cell configuration. The specific capacity and cyclability of composite were compared to parent CNT and oxidized CNT. Full article"
Incremental Capacity Analysis-Based Impact Study of Diverse Usage Patterns on Lithium-Ion Battery Aging in Electrified Vehicles,Meng Huang,2019,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries5030059,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/3/59/pdf?version=1567395370,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/3/59,12,"Aging assessment is critical for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as the technology of choice for energy storage in electrified vehicles (EVs). Existing research is mainly focused on either increasing modeling precision or improving algorithm efficiency, while the significance of data applied for aging assessment has been largely overlooked. Moreover, reported studies are mostly confined to a specific condition without considering the impacts of diverse usage patterns on battery aging, which is practically challenging and can greatly affect battery degradation. This paper addresses these issues through incremental capacity (IC) analysis, which can both utilize data directly available from on-board sensors and interpret degradations from a physics-based perspective. Through IC analysis, the optimal health feature (HF) and the state of charge (SOC)-based optimal data profile for battery aging assessment have been identified. Four stress factors, i.e., depth-of-discharge (DOD), charging C-rate, operating mode, and temperature, have been selected to jointly characterize diverse usage patterns. Impact analysis of different stress factors through the optimal HF with the SOC-based optimal data profile from aging campaign experiments have generated practical guidance on usage patterns to improve battery health monitoring and lifetime control strategies.

They are also the most widely used electric energy storage device but too much space is needed to increase energy storage. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density, allowing them to store more energy than other types of batteries. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the factors affecting the capacity design of lithium-ion stationary batteries. Factors that need to be considered in calculating the capacity of stationary lithium-ion batteries are investigated and reviewed, and based on the results, a method of calculating capacity of stationary lithium-ion batteries for industrial use is proposed.

Effect of Current Rate and Prior Cycling on the Coulombic Efficiency of a Lithium-Ion Battery,"Seyed Saeed Madani, Erik Schaltz, Søren Knudsen Kær",2019,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries5030057,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/3/57/pdf?version=1565941761,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/3/57,19,"The determination of coulombic efficiency of the lithium-ion batteries can contribute to comprehend better their degradation behavior. In this research, the coulombic efficiency and capacity loss of three lithium-ion batteries at different current rates (C) were investigated. Two new battery cells were discharged and charged at 0.4 C and 0.8 C for twenty times to monitor the variations in the aging and coulombic efficiency of the battery cell. In addition, prior cycling was applied to the third battery cell which consist of charging and discharging with 0.2 C, 0.4 C, 0.6 C, and 0.8 C current rates and each of them twenty times. The coulombic efficiency of the new battery cells was compared with the cycled one. The experiments demonstrated that approximately all the charge that was stored in the battery cell was extracted out of the battery cell, even at the bigger charging and discharging currents. The average capacity loss rates for discharge and charge during 0.8 C were approximately 0.44% and 0.45% per cycle, correspondingly. Full article"

This paper reports a proof-of-concept study of using a novel approach to the glycine-nitrate process (GNP) to synthesize sodium vanadium phosphate (Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 or NVP) materials with both high-energy (102 mAh g −1 at C/20) and high-power characteristics (60 mAh g −1 at 20 C). Glucose-derived hard carbons (GDHCs) were optimized to reduce both sloping and irreversible capacity. The best results were achieved for electrodes with active material heat treated at 1400 °C and reduced Super P additive. Sloping region capacity 90 mAh g −1 , irreversible capacity 47 mAh g −1 , discharge capacity 272 mAh g −1 (of which plateau 155 mAh g −1 ) and 1st cycle coulombic efficiency (CE) 85% were demonstrated. GDHC||NVP full cell achieved 80 mAh g −1 (reversible) by NVP mass out of which 60 mAh g −1 was the plateau (3.4 V) region capacity. Full cell specific energy and energy density reached 189 Wh kg −1 and 104 Wh dm −3 , respectively. After 80 cycles, including rate testing from C/20 to 10 C, the cell cycled at 65 mAh g −1 with 99.7% CE. With further optimization, this method can have very high industrial potential. Full article"
A Bilevel Equalizer to Boost the Capacity of Second Life Li Ion Batteries,"Ngalula Sandrine Mubenga, Kripa Sharma, Thomas Stuart",2019,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries5030055,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/3/55/pdf?version=1564663738,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/3/55,18,"There is a strong interest in second life applications for the growing number of used electric vehicle (EV) batteries, but capacity variations amongst these used cells present a problem. Even when these cells are matched for capacity, some imbalance is bound to remain, and a few lower capacity cells are also likely to develop after the pack begins its second life. Conventional cell voltage equalizers (EQU) do not address this problem, and they only provide a battery discharge capacity that is exactly equal to that of the weakest cell in the pack. This can easily result in a capacity loss of perhaps 20% to 25%, or more. This indicates the need for a new class of EQUs that can provide a discharge capacity that is close to the average of the cells, instead of the weakest cell. It is proposed to call these “capacity EQUs”, and the properties they must have are described. One such EQU is the bilevel equalizer (BEQ), described previously. This present paper provides an enhanced analysis of the BEQ and improved modelling methods. It also presents more details that are necessary to implement the microcontroller algorithm for the BEQ hardware. Full article"

Over 2000 artificial 3D structures, assuming a positive electrode composed of randomly packed spheres as the active material particles, are generated, and the charge/discharge specific resistance has been evaluated using a simplified physico-chemical model. The specific resistance from Li diffusion in the active material particles (diffusion resistance), the transfer specific resistance of Li+ in the electrolyte (electrolyte resistance), and the reaction resistance on the interface between the active material and electrolyte are simulated, based on the mass balance of Li, Ohm’s law, and the linearized Butler–Volmer equation, respectively. Using these simulation results, regression models, using an artificial neural network (ANN), have been created in order to predict the charge/discharge specific resistance from porous structure features. In this study, porosity, active material particle size and volume fraction, pressure in the compaction process, electrolyte conductivity, and binder/additives volume fraction are adopted, as features associated with controllable process parameters for manufacturing the battery electrode. As a result, the predicted electrode specific resistance by the ANN regression model is in good agreement with the simulated values. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses and an optimization of the process parameters have been carried out. Although the proposed approach is based only on the simulation results, it could serve as a reference for the determination of process parameters in battery electrode manufacturing. Full article"
Generalized Distribution of Relaxation Times Analysis for the Characterization of Impedance Spectra,Michael A.

As an extension and enhancement of the standard impedance spectroscopy, the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis was established, where the spectra are transferred from frequency into time domain. The DRT helps to analyze complex impedance spectra by identifying the number of polarization processes involved without prior assumptions and by separating and quantifying their single polarization contributions. The DRT analysis, as introduced in literature, claims to be a model-free approach for the characterization of resistive-capacitive systems. However, a data preprocessing step based on impedance models is often required to exclude non-resistive-capacitive components off the measured impedance spectra. The generalized distribution of relaxation times (GDRT) analysis presented in this work is dedicated to complex superposed impedance spectra that include ohmic, inductive, capacitive, resistive-capacitive, and resistive-inductive effects. The simplified work flow without preprocessing steps leads to a reliable and reproducible DRT analysis that fulfills the assumption of being model-free. The GDRT is applicable for the analysis of electrochemical, electrical, and even for non-electrical systems. Results are shown for a lithium-ion battery, a vanadium redox flow battery, and for a double-layer capacitor. Full article"

The battery has been in operation for 9–10 months. During this time the battery has achieve a full cycle efficiency of approximately 65%. A slight reduction in efficiency is the result of the constant auxiliary power consumption from pumps amounting to 8–9% of rated power, meanwhile the stack is quite efficient showing a cycle efficiency of 73%.The operation of the pumps has been adjusted to fix the current density applied together with the state of charge in order to reduce unnecessary consumption related to the energy required for pumping. According to the results obtained, the intended improvement in global efficiency for the system has not been achieved by this proposed strategy. However, the flow factor evolution selected at this stage needs further optimization in order to establish a trade-off between the concentration overpotential and a detrimental loss in energy due to pumping. Therefore, one should be able to improve system performance through a better configuration of flow factors in order to reach total system efficiencies of 70–75% required for achieving a commercially viable product.

Twenty-five peer-reviewed journal and conference papers that consider the whole LIB life cycle and describe their EOL modelling approach sufficiently were analyzed. The studies were categorized based on two archetypal EOL modelling approaches in LCA: The cutoff (no material recovery, possibly secondary material input) and EOL recycling (material recovery, only primary material input) approaches. It was found that 19 of the studies followed the EOL recycling approach and 6 the cutoff approach. In addition, almost a third of the studies deviated from the expected setup of the two methods by including both material recovery and secondary material input. Such hybrid approaches may lead to double counting of recycling benefits by both including secondary input (as in the cutoff approach) and substituting primary materials (as in the EOL recycling approach). If the archetypal EOL modelling approaches are not followed, it is imperative that the modelling choices are well-documented and motivated to avoid double counting that leads to over- or underestimations of the environmental impacts of LIBs. Also, 21 studies model hydrometallurgical treatment, and 17 completely omit waste collection. Full article"

To curb the imbalance, energy storage systems comprising batteries and supercapacitors are widely employed. However, due to the variety of operational conditions, the performance prediction of the energy storage systems entails a substantial complexity that leads to capacity utilization issues. The current article attempts to precisely predict the performance of a lithium-ion battery and capacitor/supercapacitor under dynamic conditions to utilize the storage capacity to a fuller extent. The grey box modeling approach involving the chemical and electrical energy transfers/interactions governed by ordinary differential equations was developed in MATLAB. The model parameters were extracted from experimental data employing regression techniques. The state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery was predicted by employing the extended Kalman (EK) estimator and the unscented Kalman (UK) estimator. The model was eventually validated via loading profile tests. As a performance indicator, the extended Kalman estimator indicated the strong competitiveness of the developed model with regard to tracking of the internal states (e.g., SoC) which have first-order nonlinearities.

The swelling and gassing of the LIC when subjected to abuse conditions is still a critical issue concerning the safe application in power electronics and commercial devices. However, it is imperative to carry out a thorough investigation that characterizes the safe operation of LICs. We investigated and studied the safety of LIC for commercial applications, by conducting a comprehensive abuse tests on LIC 200 F pouch cells with voltage range from 3.8 V to 2.2 V manufactured by General Capacitors LLC.

Even though the continuous development of laser sources, beam guiding, and handling systems enable industrial relevant high cycle times, there are still uncertainties regarding the influence of, for this process, typical cutting edge characteristics on the electrochemical performance. To investigate this issue, conventional anodes and cathodes were cut by a pulsed fiber laser with a central emission wavelength of 1059–1065 nm and a pulse duration of 240 ns. Based on investigations considering the pulse repetition frequency, cutting speed, and line energy, a cell setup of anodes and cathodes with different cutting edge characteristics were selected. The experiments on 9 Ah pouch cells demonstrated that the cutting edge of the cathode had a greater impact on the electrochemical performance than the cutting edge of the anode. Furthermore, the results pointed out that on the cathode side, the contamination through metal spatters, generated by the laser current collector interaction, had the largest impact on the electrochemical performance.

An Optimal Combined Design was used to identify influential factors and pinpoint the optimal formulation, according to the projected use. Our methodology follows an eight-step workflow adapted from the literature. Once the study objectives are clearly identified, it is necessary to consider the time, cost, and complexity of an experiment before choosing the responses that best describe the system, as well as the factors to vary. By strategically selecting the mixtures to be characterized, it is possible to minimize the number of experiments, and obtain a statistically relevant empirical equation which links responses and design factors.

Typically, electrode-separator lamination shows a reduced capacity fade at fast-charging cycles. To study this behavior in detail, the anode and cathode were laminated separately to the separator and compared to the fully laminated and non-laminated state in single-cell format. The impedance of the cells was measured at different states of charge and during the cycling test up to 1500 fast-charging cycles. Lamination on the cathode interface clearly shows an initial decrease in the surface resistance with no correlation to aging effects along cycling, while lamination on both electrode-separator interfaces reduces the growth of the surface resistance along cycling. Lamination only on the anode-separator interface shows up to be sufficient to maintain the enhanced fast-charging capability for 1500 cycles, what we prove to arise from a significant reduction in growth of the solid electrolyte interface.

Experimental Study of Heat Generation Rate during Discharge of LiFePO4Pouch Cells of Different Nominal Capacities and Thickness,"Shashank Arora, Ajay Kapoor",2019,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries5040070,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/4/70/pdf?version=1573463971,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/4/70,19,"High manufacturing cost and thermal stability of Li-ion battery cells are currently the two main deterrents to prolific demand for electric vehicles. A plausible solution to this issue is a modular/scalable battery thermal management system (TMS). A modular TMS can ensure thermal reliability for battery cells of different capacities and size without needing major structural revision besides facilitating mass-production. However, understanding the relationship of heat generation rates with cell capacity and thickness is essential for developing a scalable TMS. The present paper discusses results derived from an experimental investigation undertaken with this purpose. Heat generation rates for LiFePO 4 pouch cells of different nominal capacities are measured at discharge rates of 0.33C, 1C and 3C in ambient temperatures ranging between −10 and 50 °C using a custom-designed calorimeter. It is observed that heat generation rates of the LiFePO 4 pouch cells become independent of their nominal capacity and thickness if the ambient temperature is regulated at 35 °C. In ambient temperatures lower than 35 °C though, the thin battery cells are found to be generating heat at rates greater than those of thick battery cells and vice-versa at temperatures over 35 °C for all discharge rates.

The effects of the precursor metal salts on particle size, morphology, cationic ordering, and ultimately, the electrode performance of the cathode powders have been studied. It was demonstrated that the use of cornstarch as a gelling agent with nitrate-based metal salts results in a reduction of particle size, leading to higher surface area and initial discharge capacity. However, the cornstarch gelling effect was minimized when acetate salts were used. As observed in the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, cornstarch can react with acetates to form acetyl groups during the synthesis, effectively preventing the cornstarch gel from capping the particles, thus leading to larger particles. A tradeoff was found when nitrate and acetate salts were mixed in the synthesis. It was shown that the new cathode powder has the best cationic ordering and capacity retention, promising a much stable Li-rich cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. Full article"
A Critical Review of Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Processes from a Circular Economy Perspective,"Omar Velázquez-Martínez, Johanna Valio, Annukka Santasalo-Aarnio, Markus Reuter, Rodrigo Serna-Guerrero",2019,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries5040068,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/4/68/pdf?version=1574505041,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/4/68,465,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently one of the most important electrochemical energy storage devices, powering electronic mobile devices and electric vehicles alike. However, there is a remarkable difference between their rate of production and rate of recycling. At the end of their lifecycle, only a limited number of LIBs undergo any recycling treatment, with the majority go to landfills or being hoarded in households. Further losses of LIB components occur because the the state-of-the-art LIB recycling processes are limited to components with high economic value, e.g., Co, Cu, Fe, and Al. With the increasing popularity of concepts such as “circular economy” (CE), new LIB recycling systems have been proposed that target a wider spectrum of compounds, thus reducing the environmental impact associated with LIB production. This review work presents a discussion of the current practices and some of the most promising emerging technologies for recycling LIBs. While other authoritative reviews have focused on the description of recycling processes, the aim of the present was is to offer an analysis of recycling technologies from a CE perspective. Consequently, the discussion is based on the ability of each technology to recover every component in LIBs. The gathered data depicted a direct relationship between process complexity and the variety and usability of the recovered fractions. Indeed, only processes employing a combination of mechanical processing, and hydro- and pyrometallurgical steps seemed able to obtain materials suitable for LIB (re)manufacture. On the other hand, processes relying on pyrometallurgical steps are robust, but only capable of recovering metallic components. Full article"

The AWG is the main component of a novel low-cost approach for an optical interrogation unit to track the FBG peak wavelength by means of intensity changes monitored by a CMOS linear image sensor, read out by a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller. The AWG was manufactured using laser direct lithography as an all-polymer-system, whereas the FBG was produced by point-by-point femtosecond laser writing. Using this system, we continuously monitored the strain variation of a battery cell during low rate charge and discharge cycles over one month under constant climate conditions and compared the results to parallel readings of an optical spectrum analyzer with special attention to the influence of the relative air humidity.

These devices combine a capacitive electrode and a battery-like material to achieve high energy-density high power-density devices with good cycling stability. In the quest of improved electrochemical responses, several hybrid devices have been proposed. However, they are usually limited to bench-scale prototypes that would likely face severe challenges during a scaling up process. The present case study reports the production of a hybrid prototype consisting of commercial activated carbon and nickel-cobalt hydroxide, obtained by chemical co-precipitation, separated by means of polyolefin-based paper. Developed to power a 12 W LED light, these materials were assembled and characterized in a coin-cell configuration and stacked to increase device voltage. All the processes have been adapted and constrained to scalable conditions to ensure reliable production of a pre-commercial device. Important challenges and limitations of this process, from geometrical constraints to increased resistance, are reported alongside their impact and optimization on the final performance, stability, and metrics of the assembled prototype.

Design Strategies for High Power vs. High Energy Lithium Ion Cells,"Michael J. Lain, James Brandon, Emma Kendrick",2019,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries5040064,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/4/64/pdf?version=1571396143,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/4/64,216,"Commercial lithium ion cells are now optimised for either high energy density or high power density. There is a trade off in cell design between the power and energy requirements. A tear down protocol has been developed, to investigate the internal components and cell engineering of nine cylindrical cells, with different power–energy ratios. The cells designed for high power applications used smaller particles of the active material in both the anodes and the cathodes. The cathodes for high power cells had higher porosities, but a similar trend was not observed for the anodes. In terms of cell design, the coat weights and areal capacities were lower for high power cells. The tag arrangements were the same in eight out of nine cells, with tags at each end of the anode, and one tag on the cathode. The thicknesses of the current collectors and separators were based on the best (thinnest) materials available when the cells were designed, rather than materials optimised for power or energy. To obtain high power, the resistance of each component is reduced as low as possible, and the lithium ion diffusion path lengths are minimised. This information illustrates the significant evolution of materials and components in lithium ion cells in recent years, and gives insight into designing higher power cells in the future.

The Influence of Micro-Structured Anode Current Collectors in Combination with Highly Concentrated Electrolyte on the Coulombic Efficiency of In-Situ Deposited Li-Metal Electrodes with Different Counter Electrodes,"Fabian Heim, Tina Kreher, Kai Peter Birke",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6010020,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/1/20/pdf?version=1585281377,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/1/20,6,"This paper compares and combines two common methods to improve the cycle performance of lithium metal (Li) electrodes. One technique is to establish a micro-structured current collector by chemical separation of a copper/zinc alloy. Furthermore, the use of a highly concentrated ether-based electrolyte is applied as a second approach for improving the cycling behavior. The influence of the two measures compared with a planar current collector and a 1 M concentrated carbonate-based electrolyte, as well as the combination of the methods, are investigated in test cells both with Li and lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) as counter electrodes. In all cases Li is in-situ plated onto the micro-structured current collectors respectively a planar copper foil without presence of any excess Li before first deposition. In experiments with Li counter electrodes, the effect of a structured current collector is not visible whereas the influence of the electrolyte can be observed. With NCM counter electrodes and carbonate-based electrolyte structured current collectors can improve Coulombic efficiency. The confirmation of this outcome in experiments with highly concentrated ether-based electrolyte is challenging due to high deviations. However, these results indicate, that improvements in Coulombic efficiency achieved by structuring the current collector’s surface and using ether-based electrolyte do not necessarily add up, if both methods are combined in one cell.

However, the solid Al–air battery suffers from anodic corrosion and it is difficult to achieve a higher specific capacity. Thus, this work aims at suppressing the corrosion of Al anode by adding an electrospun Al 2 O 3 interlayer on to the surface of the anode. The Al 2 O 3 interlayer effectively inhibits the self-corrosion of the Al anode. Further, the effects of the thickness of the Al 2 O 3 film on corrosion behavior were investigated. The results showed that the Al–air battery with a 4 μm Al 2 O 3 interlayer is more suitable for a low current density discharge, which could be applied for mini-watt devices. With a proper thickness of the Al 2 O 3 interlayer, corrosion of the anode was considerably suppressed without sacrificing the discharge voltage at a low current density. The Al–air battery with a 4 μm Al 2 O 3 interlayer provided a significantly high capacity (1255 mAh/g at 5 mA/cm 2 ) and an excellent stability. This wo presents a promising approach for fabricating an inhibiting corrosion interlayer for solid Al–air battery designed for mini-watt devices. Full article"

The influence of cooling direction and conduit distribution on the thermal performance of the lithium-ion battery is analyzed. The outcomes exhibit that the appropriate flow rate for heat dissipation is dependent on different configurations for cold plate. The acceptable heat dissipation condition could be acquired by adding more cooling conduits. Moreover, it was distinguished that satisfactory cooling direction could efficiently enhance the homogeneity of temperature distribution of the lithium-ion battery. Full article"

Black copper smelting is a flexible recycling route for many different types of scrap, including Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and some end-of-life energy storage materials. Fundamental thermodynamic data about the behavior of battery metals and the effect of slag additives is required for providing data necessary for process development, control, and optimization. The goal of our study is to investigate the suitability of black copper smelting process for recycling of battery metals lithium, cobalt, manganese, and lanthanum. The experiments were performed alumina crucibles at 1300 °C, in oxygen partial pressure range of 10 −11 –10 −8 atm. The slags studied contained 0 to 6 wt% of MgO. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques were utilized for phase composition quantifications. The results reveal that most cobalt can be recovered into the copper alloy in extremely reducing process conditions, whereas lithium, manganese, and lanthanum deport predominantly in the slag at all investigated oxygen partial pressures.

To enhance the discharge power density of zinc slurry air flow batteries, an optimum slurry distribution in the cell is key. Hence, several types of flow fields (serpentine, parallel, plastic flow frames) were tested in this study to improve the discharge power density of the battery. The serpentine flow field delivered a power density of 55 mW∙cm −2 , while parallel and flow frame resulted in 30 mW∙cm −2 and 10 mW∙cm −2 , respectively. Moreover, when the anode bipolar plate material was changed from graphite to copper, the power density of the flow frame increased to 65 mW∙cm −2 , and further improvement was attained when the bipolar plate material was further changed to copper–nickel. These results show the potential to increase the power density of slurry-based flow batteries by flow field optimization and design of bipolar plate materials. Full article"
Modelling Lithium-Ion Battery Ageing in Electric Vehicle Applications—Calendar and Cycling Ageing Combination Effects,"Eduardo Redondo-Iglesias, Pascal Venet, Serge Pelissier",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6010014,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/1/14/pdf?version=1585122508,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/1/14,67,"Battery ageing is an important issue in e-mobility applications. The performance degradation of lithium-ion batteries has a strong influence on electric vehicles’ range and cost. Modelling capacity fade of lithium-ion batteries is not simple: many ageing mechanisms can exist and interact. Because calendar and cycling ageings are not additive, a major challenge is to model battery ageing in applications where the combination of cycling and rest periods are variable as, for example, in the electric vehicle application. In this work, an original approach to capacity fade modelling based on the formulation of reaction rate of a two-step reaction is proposed. A simple but effective model is obtained: based on only two differential equations and seven parameters, it can reproduce the capacity evolution of lithium-ion cells subjected to cycling profiles similar to those found in electric vehicle applications.

Investigations have mainly been performed at homogeneous temperatures and non-homogeneous conditions in single cells have at best been simulated. This publication presents the development of a methodology and experimental setup to investigate the influence of thermal boundary conditions during the operation of lithium-ion cells. In particular, spatially inhomogeneous and transient thermal boundary conditions and periodical electrical cycles were superimposed in different combinations. This required a thorough design of the thermal boundary conditions applied to the cells. Unlike in other contributions that rely on placing cells in a climatic chamber to control ambient air temperature, here the cell surfaces and tabs were directly connected to individual cooling and heating plates. This improves the control of the cells’ internal temperature, even with high currents accompanied by strong internal heat dissipation. The aging process over a large number of electrical cycles is presented by means of discharge capacity and impedance spectra determined in repeated intermediate characterizations. The influence of spatial temperature gradients and temporal temperature changes on the cyclic degradation is revealed. It appears that the overall temperature level is indeed a decisive parameter for capacity fade during cyclic aging, while the intensity of a temperature gradient is not as essential. Furthermore, temperature changes can have a substantial impact and potentially lead to stronger degradation than spatial inhomogeneities. Full article"

There are several studies in literature that investigate the aging behavior under electrical load, but are limited to homogeneous, constant temperatures. This article presents an approach to quantifying cyclic aging of lithium-ion cells that takes into account complex thermal boundary conditions. It not only considers different temperature levels but also spatial and transient temperature gradients that can occur despite-or even due to-the use of thermal management systems. Capacity fade and impedance rise are used as measured quantities for degradation and correlated with the temperature boundary conditions during the aging process. The concept and definition of an equivalent aging temperature (EAT) is introduced to relate the degradation caused by spatial and temporal temperature inhomogeneities to similar degradation caused by a homogeneous steady temperature during electrical cycling. The results show an increased degradation at both lower and higher temperatures, which can be very well described by two superimposed exponential functions. These correlations also apply to cells that are cycled under the influence of spatial temperature gradients, both steady and transient. Only cells that are exposed to transient, but spatially homogeneous temperature conditions show a significantly different aging behavior. The concluding result is a correlation between temperature and aging rate, which is expressed as degradation per equivalent full cycle (EFC). This enables both temperature-dependent modeling of the aging behavior and its prediction. Full article"

Na, K, and Ca are promising as the basis for battery chemistries in that these elements are highly abundant. Here, a series of single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SIPEs) for Na, K, and Ca batteries are synthesized and investigated. The two classes of metal cation neutralized SIPEs compared are crosslinked poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate-x-styrene sulfonate (PEGDMA-SS) and poly(tetrahydrofuran) diacrylate-x-4-styrenesulfonyl (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PTHFDA-STFSI); three cation types, three charge densities, and four swelling states are examined. The impact on conductivity of all of these parameters is studied, and in conjunction with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), it is found that promoting ion dissociation and preventing the formation of dense ionic aggregates facilitates ion transport. These results indicate many of the lessons learned from the Li SIPE literature can be translated to beyond Li chemistries. At 25 °C, the best performing Na/K and Ca exchanged polymers yield active cation conductivity on the order of 10 −4 S/cm and 10 −6 S/cm, respectively, for ethylene carbonate:propylene carbonate gelled SIPEs, and 10 −5 S/cm and 10 −7 S/cm, respectively, for glyme gelled SIPEs.

The samples under analysis are state-of-the art batteries obtained from a fully electric vehicle commercialized in 2016. The proposed methodology does not require a laboratory equipped to manage hazardous chemical substances as the battery does not need to be disassembled. The principle of the measurement methodology consists of forcing a thermal gradient on the battery along the desired direction and measuring the heat flux and temperature after the steady state condition has been reached. A thermoelectric device has been built in order to force the thermal gradient and keep it stable over a long period of time in order to be able to observe the temperatures in steady state condition. Aligned with other measurement methodologies, the results revealed that the thermal conductivity in the thickness direction (0.77 Wm −1 K −1 ) is lower with respect to the other two directions (25.55 Wm −1 K −1 and 25.74 Wm −1 K −1 ) to about a factor ×35.

The Nernst voltage loss in fuel cells in most of the current literature is thought to be due to the difference in concentration of reaction gas in the flow channel and concentration of reaction gas on the catalyst layer at the time as when the high net current density is generated. Based on the Butler–Volmer equation in the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, this paper demonstrates that Nernst voltage loss caused by concentration difference of reaction gas in the flow channel and reaction gas on the catalyst layer at equilibrium potential. According to the relationship between the current density and the concentration difference it can be proven that Nernst voltage loss does not exist in hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells because there is no concentration difference of reaction gas in the flow channel and on the catalytic layer at equilibrium potential when the net current density is zero.

Battery manufacturers thus have an interest in the aging prediction during the early design phase, for which semi-empirical aging models are often used. The progress of aging is dependent on the application-specific load profile, more precisely on the aging-relevant stress factors. Still, a literature review reveals a controversy on the aging-relevant stress factors to use as input parameters for the simulation models. It shows that, at present, a systematic and efficient procedure for stress factor selection is missing, as the aging characteristic is cell-specific. In this study, an accelerated sensitivity analysis as a prior step to aging modeling is proposed, which is transferable and allows to determine the actual aging-relevant stress factors for a specific lithium-ion cell. For the assessment of this accelerated approach, two test series with different acceleration levels and cell types are performed and evaluated. The results show that a certain amount of charge throughput, 100 equivalent full cycles in this case, is necessary to conduct a statistically significant sensitivity analysis. Full article"

An enhancement in the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes occurs by synthesizing highly porous structures and achieving more surface area. In this work, a chemical precipitation technique was used to synthesize the NiMoO 4 /3D-rGO nanocomposite in a starch media. Starch was used to develop the porosities of the nanostructure. A temperature of 350 °C was applied to transform graphene oxide sheets to reduced graphene oxide and remove the starch to obtain the NiMoO 4 /3D-rGO nanocomposite with porous structure. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the NiMoO 4 nano particles indicated a monoclinic structure. Also, the scanning electron microscope observation showed that the NiMoO 4 NPs were dispersed across the rGO sheets. The electrochemical results of the NiMoO 4 /3D-rGO electrode revealed that the incorporation of rGO sheets with NiMoO 4 NPs increased the capacity of the nanocomposite. Therefore, a significant increase in the specific capacity of the electrode was observed with the NiMoO 4 /3D-rGO nanocomposite (450 Cg −1 or 900 Fg −1 ) when compared with bare NiMoO 4 nanoparticles (350 Cg −1 or 700 Fg −1 ) at the current density of 1 A g −1 . Our findings show that the incorporation of rGO and NiMoO 4 NP redox reactions with a porous structure can benefit the future development of supercapacitors. Full article"

In our previous work, an electrochemical model for a commercially-available, 40 Ah Ah prismatic lithium–ion battery was validated under heuristic temperature dependence. In this work the validated electrochemical model is coupled to a spatially resolved, three dimensional (3D), thermal model of the same battery to evaluate the thermal characteristics, i.e., thermal barriers and preferential heat rejection patterns, within common environment layouts. We discuss to which extent the knowledge of the batteries’ interior layout can be constructively used for the design of an exterior battery thermal management. It is found from the study results that: (1) Increasing the current rate without considering an increased heat removal flux at natural convection at higher temperatures will lead to increased model deviations; (2) Centralized fan air-cooling within a climate chamber in a multi cell test arrangement can lead to significantly different thermal characteristics at each battery cell; (3) Increasing the interfacial surface area, at which preferential battery interior and exterior heat rejection match, can significantly lower the temperature rise and inhomogeneity within the electrode stack and increase the batteries’ lifespan.

This allows to reconstruct arising temperature gradients in a battery module and to investigate their effects on the current distribution. The influence of additional contact resistances induced by the test bench is determined and minimized. The contact resistances are reduced from R Tab + = 81.18 R Tab + = 81.18 μ Ω μ Ω to R Tab + = 55.15 R Tab + = 55.15 μ Ω μ Ω at the positive respectively from R Tab − = 35.59 R Tab − = 35.59 μ Ω μ Ω to R Tab − = 28.2 R Tab − = 28.2 μ Ω μ Ω at the negative tab by mechanical and chemical treating. An increase of the contact resistance at the positive tab is prevented by air seal of the contact. The resistance of the load cable must not be arbitrarily small, as the cable is used as a shunt for current measurement. In order to investigate their impacts, measurements with two parallel-connected cells and different load cables with a resistance of R Cab + = 0.3 R Cab + = 0.3 m Ω Ω , R Cab + = 1.6 R Cab + = 1.6 m Ω Ω and R Cab + = 4.35 R Cab + = 4.35 m Ω Ω are conducted. A shift to lower current differences with decreasing cable resistance but qualitatively the same dynamic of the current distribution is found.

Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation for Degrading Lithium-Ion Batteries in Electric Vehicles Using Parameter Estimation with Recursive Least Squares,"Manh-Kien Tran, Michael Fowler",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6010001,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/1/1/pdf?version=1577444345,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/1/1,67,"With the increase in usage of electric vehicles (EVs), the demand for Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is also on the rise. The battery management system (BMS) plays an important role in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the battery in EVs. Sensor faults in the BMS can have significant negative effects on the system, hence it is important to diagnose these faults in real-time. Existing sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) methods have not considered battery degradation. Degradation can affect the long-term performance of the battery and cause false fault detection. This paper presents a model-based sensor FDI scheme for a Li-ion cell undergoing degradation. The proposed scheme uses the recursive least squares (RLS) method to estimate the equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters in real time. The estimated ECM parameters are put through weighted moving average (WMA) filters, and then cumulative sum control charts (CUSUM) are implemented to detect any significant deviation between unfiltered and filtered data, which would indicate a fault. The current and voltage faults are isolated based on the responsiveness of the parameters when each fault occurs. The proposed FDI scheme is then validated through conducting a series of experiments and simulations. Full article"
Investigation of the Effects of Charging Processes on Lithium-Ion Cells with SiC Anodes at Low Temperatures,"Ralph Bednorz, Tanja Gewald",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6020034,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/2/34/pdf?version=1592485751,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/2/34,12,"Lithium-ion cells with a silicon-graphite (SiC) anode and a nickel-rich cathode are potential candidates for use in electric vehicles (EVs) as this material combination offers high energy densities and low costs. Another desired cell specification that results from an intended short charging time for EVs is the robustness against high charge rates. However, high charge rates can lead to the critical aging mechanism of lithium plating, especially at low temperatures. Investigating this issue, this paper presents a test series on cyclic aging with varying charge rates from 0.2C to 1.5C at ambient temperatures of 0 °C and 10 °C applied to a nickel-rich SiC cell candidate. The resulting effects on cell aging are analyzed with a stripping method, whereby reversible lithium plating can be detected, and a differential voltage analysis (DVA), whereby the overall loss of capacity can be attributed to changes in individual characteristic capacities. The results indicate a degradation sensitivity of SiC anodes at elevated charge rates, evidenced by the loss in the silicon-related characteristic capacity, and question the aging robustness of this material combination.

Aging of Extracted and Reassembled Li-ion Electrode Material in Coin Cells—Capabilities and Limitations,"Alexander Uwe Schmid, Alexander Ridder, Matthias Hahn, Kai Schofer, Kai Peter Birke",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6020033,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/2/33/pdf?version=1593502321,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/2/33,7,"Cycling Li-ion cells with large capacities requires high currents and hence an expensive measurement setup. Aging the Li-ion cell material in coin cells offers an orders-of-magnitude-lower power requirement to the battery tester. The preparation procedure used in this work allows one to build coin cells in a reproducible manner. The original 40 Ah pouch cells and the corresponding 4.3 mAh coin cells (PAT-Cell) utilizing electrode material from the original cells are cycled with 1C at different temperatures. The results show the same basic aging mechanisms in both cell types: loss of lithium inventory at room temperature but an increasing proportion of loss of active material toward higher temperatures. This is confirmed by similar activation energies in capacity degradation of the 40 Ah cells and the averaged coin cells. However, the capacity of the coin cells decreases faster over time. This is caused by diffusion of moisture into the coin cell housing. Nonetheless, the increasing water contamination over measurement time is not directly linked to the loss of capacity of the coin cells. Thus, the observed aging mechanisms of the 40 Ah cells can be qualitatively transferred to coin cell level. Full article"

Comparing internal resistance, the conventional parameter estimation method yields a different value than EIS. Therefore, a hysteresis-free parameter identification method based on ECM is proposed. The proposed technique separates hysteresis resistance from the effective resistance. It precisely estimated actual internal resistance, which matches the internal resistance obtained from EIS. In addition, state of charge, open circuit voltage, and different internal equivalent circuit components were identified. The least square method was used to identify the parameters based on ECM.

A battery thermal management system is essential for lithium-ion batteries. With the extensive utilization of liquid-cooling approaches for lithium-ion batteries’ thermal management, temperature homogeneity is considerably influenced by coolant distribution. A lower temperature of the cooling fluid brings about a lower temperature of the cell, but the relation and the amount are important to be analyzed. The cooling efficiency is considerably influenced by the flowing conduit arrangement in the cooling plate. Different parameters are affected by the cooling performance of the battery pack. Consequently, the effect of entrance temperature of coolant fluid, current rate, environment temperature, entrance velocity of the coolant fluid, and plate material on the performance and efficiency of a battery thermal management system were investigated. In this investigation, the program ANSYS/FLUENT was employed as the numerical solver to solve the problem. The simulation was accomplished after the end of the discharge. It was seen that the temperature distributions were the most sensitive to the entrance velocity of coolant fluid. It was concluded that the entrance velocity of coolant fluid has the greatest impact on the cooling efficiency and performance of the cold plate. Full article"

However, there are serious hazards resulting from failing battery cells leading to exothermic chemical reactions inside the cell, called thermal runaway (TR). Literature of quantifying the failing behavior of modern automotive high capacity cells is rare and focusing on single hazard categories such as heat generation. Thus, the aim of this study is to quantify several hazard relevant parameters of a failing currently used battery cell extracted from a modern mass-produced EV: the temperature response of the cell, the maximum reached cell surface temperature, the amount of produced vent gas, the gas venting rate, the composition of the produced gases including electrolyte vapor and the size and composition of the produced particles at TR. For this purpose, overtemperature experiments with fresh 41 Ah automotive lithium NMC/LMO—graphite pouch cells at different state-of-charge (SOC) 100%, 30% and 0% are performed.

We start with a simplified phase-field model for a single submicron particle under galvanostatic condition. We observe two stages associated with single-phase and double-phase patterns typical for both charging and discharging processes. The single-phase stage takes approximately 10–15% of the process and plays an important role in the intercalation dynamics. We establish the laws for speed of front propagation and evolution of single-phase concentration valid for different sizes of electrode particles and a wide range of temperatures and C-rates. The universality of these laws allows us to formulate the boundary condition with time-dependent flux density for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and analyze the phase-field intercalation in a heterogeneous cathode characterized by the particle size distribution.

Therefore, there is a necessity to compare technical and economic aspects of different technologies for each transport application. This article presents a comparison of three bus prototypes in terms of dynamic performance. The analysis is based on the collection of real data (acceleration, maximum speed and energy consumption) under different settings. Each developed prototype uses the same bus chassis but relies on different energy storage systems. Results show that the dynamic bus performance is independent on the three energy storage technologies, whereas technologies affect the management costs, charging time and available range. An extensive experimental analysis reveals that the bus equipped with a hybrid storage (lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors) had the most favorable net present value, in comparison with storage composed of only lead–acid or lithium-ion batteries. This result is due to the greater life of lithium-ion batteries and to the capability of supercapacitors, which reduce both batteries depth of discharge and discharge rate. Full article"

Today’s batteries for electric vehicles consist of large quantities of single battery cells to reach the desired nominal voltage and energy. Each single cell needs a contacting of its cell terminals, which raises the necessity of an automated contacting process with low joint resistances to reduce the energy loss in the cell transitions. A capable joining process suitable for highly electrically conductive materials like copper or aluminium is the laser beam welding. This study contains the theoretical examination of the joint resistance and a simulation of the current flow dependent on the contacting welds’ position in an overlap configuration. The results are verified by examinations of laser-welded joints in a test bench environment. The investigations are analysing the influence of the shape and position of the weld seams as well as the influence of the laser welding parameters. The investigation identifies a tendency for current to flow predominantly through a contact’s edges. The use of a double weld seam with the largest possible distance greatly increases the joint’s conductivity, by leveraging this tendency and implementing a parallel connection. A simplistic increase of welded contact area does not only have a significantly smaller effect on the overall conductivity, but can eventually also reduce it. Full article"

Based on a coating loading tolerance of ±0.4 mg/cm 2 and calender tolerance of ±3.0 μm, the resulting theoretical range of physical properties was investigated. For a target positive electrode porosity of 30%, the resulting porosity can range from 19.6% to 38.6%. To account for this variation during the manufacturing process, as much as 41% excess or as little as 59% of the target electrolyte quantity should be added to cells to match the positive electrode void volume. Similar results are reported for a negative electrode of 40% target porosity, where a range from 30.8% to 48.0% porosity is possible. For the negative electrode as little as 72% up to 28% excess electrolyte should be added to fill the internal void space. Although the results are specific to each electrode composition, density, chemistry, and loading the presented process highlight the possible variability of the produced parts. These results are further magnified as cell design moves toward higher power applications with thinner electrode coatings. Full article"
Effect of Ball Milling on the Electrochemical Performance of Activated Carbon with a Very High Specific Surface Area,"Takuya Eguchi, Yugo Kanamoto, Masahiro Tomioka, Daisuke Tashima, Seiji Kumagai",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6020022,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/2/22/pdf?version=1586867656,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/2/22,26,"Activated carbon (AC) with a very high specific surface area of >3000 m 2 g −1 and a number of course particles (average size: 75 µm) was pulverized by means of planetary ball milling under different conditions to find its greatest performances as the active material of an electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) using a nonaqueous electrolyte. The variations in textural properties and particle morphology of the AC during the ball milling were investigated. The electrochemical performance (specific capacitance, rate and cyclic stabilities, and Ragone plot, both from gravimetric and volumetric viewpoints) was also evaluated for the ACs milled with different particle size distributions. A trade-off relation between the pulverization and the porosity maintenance of the AC was observed within the limited milling time. However, prolonged milling led to a degeneration of pores within the AC and a saturation of pulverization degree. The appropriate milling time provided the AC a high volumetric specific capacitance, as well as the greatest maintenance of both the gravimetric and volumetric specific capacitance. A high volumetric energy density of 6.6 Wh L −1 was attained at the high-power density of 1 kW L −1 , which was a 35% increment compared with the nonmilled AC. The electrode densification (decreased interparticle gap) and the enhanced ion-transportation within the AC pores, which were attributed to the pulverization, were responsible for those excellent performances. It was also shown that excessive milling could degrade the EDLC performances because of the lowered micro- and meso-porosity and the excessive electrode densification to restrict the ion-transportation within the pores.

As shown previously, the lamination technique is beneficial for the capacity aging in graphite-LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 cells. Here, surface resistance growth phenomena are quantified using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The graphite anodes were extracted from the graphite NMC cells in their fully discharged state and irreversible accumulations of lithium in the SEI are revealed using neutron depth profiling (NDP). In this post-mortem study, NDP reveals uniform lithium accumulations as a function of depth with lithium situated at the surface of the graphite particles thus forming the SEI. The SEI was found to grow logarithmically with cycle number starting with the main formation in the initial cycles. Furthermore, the EIS measurements indicate that benefits from lamination arise from surface resistance growth phenomena aside from SEI growth in superior anode fractions. Full article"

Graphene is one of the most promising carbon supports for sulfur, thanks to its excellent conductivity and to the possibility of tailoring its chemical–physical properties, introducing heteroatoms in its structure. By using first principle density functional theory simulations, this work aims at studying the effect of doping graphene with group III elements (B, Al, Ga) on its electronic properties and on its chemical affinity towards lithium polysulfides. Our results show that Al and Ga doping strongly modify the local structure of the lattice near heteroatom site and generate a charge transfer between the dopant and its nearest neighbor carbon atoms. This effect makes the substrate more polar and greatly enhances the adsorption energy of polysulfides.

We also demonstrate its utility by establishing an ECM of the thermal management systems of the actual battery packs. Experiments simulating the liquid cooling of a battery pack are performed, and a three-dimensional (3D) model is established. The 3D model reproduces the heat generated by the battery and the heat transfer to the coolant. The results of the 3D model agree well with the experimental data. Further, the relationship between the flow rate and pressure drop or between the flow rate and heat transfer coefficients is predicted with the 3D model, and the data are used for the ECM, which is established using MATLAB Simulink.

The first is a resistor capacitor (RC) equivalent circuit model, and the second is a generic Simscape model. The model validation is based on the generation and evaluation of the SOC residual error. The SOC reference value required for the calculation of residual errors is the value estimated by an ADVISOR 3.2 simulator, one of the software tools most used in automotive applications.

The battery SOC of both Li-ion battery models is estimated using a linearized adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), a nonlinear adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) and a nonlinear and non-Gaussian particle filter estimator (PFE). The result of MATLAB simulations shows the efficiency of all three SOC estimators, especially AEKF, followed in order of decreasing performance by AUKF and PFE. Besides, this result reveals a slight superiority of the SOC estimation accuracy when using the Simscape model for SOC estimator design. Overall, the performance of all three SOC estimators in terms of accuracy, convergence of response speed and robustness is excellent and is comparable to state of the art SOC estimation methods.

In this regard, it is crucial to identify an adequate model to study the thermal behavior of a battery. This article reports a comparative study on thermal modeling approaches by using a LiCoO 2 LiCoO 2 26650 lithium-ion battery, and provides a methodology to characterize electrothermal phenomena. Three approaches have been implemented numerically—a thermal lumped model, a 3D computational fluid dynamics model, and an electrochemical model based on Newman, Tiedemann, Gu and Kim formulation. The last two methods were solved using ANSYS Fluent software. Simulations were validated with experimental measurements of the cell surface temperature at constant current discharge and under a highway driving cycle. Results show that the three models are consistent with actual temperature measurements. The electrochemical method has the lower error at 0.5C. Nevertheless, this model provides the higher error ( 1.3 1.3 ∘ C ∘ C ) at 1.5C, where the maximum temperature increase of the cell was 18.1 18.1 ∘ C ∘ C . Under the driving cycle, all the models are in the same order of error. Lumped model is suitable to simulate a wide range of battery operating conditions. Furthermore, this work was expanded to study heat generation, voltage and heat transfer coefficient under natural convection. Full article"
Cell Replacement Strategies for Lithium Ion Battery Packs,"Nenad G. Nenadic, Thomas A. Trabold, Michael G. Thurston",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6030039,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/3/39/pdf?version=1595563567,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/3/39,10,"The economic value of high-capacity battery systems, being used in a wide variety of automotive and energy storage applications, is strongly affected by the duration of their service lifetime. Because many battery systems now feature a very large number of individual cells, it is necessary to understand how cell-to-cell interactions can affect durability, and how to best replace poorly performing cells to extend the lifetime of the entire battery pack. This paper first examines the baseline results of aging individual cells, then aging of cells in a representative 3S3P battery pack, and compares them to the results of repaired packs. The baseline results indicate nearly the same rate of capacity fade for single cells and those aged in a pack; however, the capacity variation due to a few degrees changes in room temperature (≃±3 ∘ ∘ C) is significant (≃±1.5% of capacity of new cell) compared to the percent change of capacity over the battery life cycle in primary applications (≃20–30%). The cell replacement strategies investigation considers two scenarios: early life failure, where one cell in a pack fails prematurely, and building a pack from used cells for less demanding applications. Early life failure replacement found that, despite mismatches in impedance and capacity, a new cell can perform adequately within a pack of moderately aged cells. The second scenario for reuse of lithium ion battery packs examines the problem of assembling a pack for less-demanding applications from a set of aged cells, which exhibit more variation in capacity and impedance than their new counterparts. The cells used in the aging comparison part of the study were deeply discharged, recovered, assembled in a new pack, and cycled. We discuss the criteria for selecting the aged cells for building a secondary pack and compare the performance and coulombic efficiency of the secondary pack to the pack built from new cells and the repaired pack. The pack that employed aged cells performed well, but its efficiency was reduced. Full article"
Evaluation of a Non-Aqueous Vanadium Redox Flow Battery Using a Deep Eutectic Solvent and Graphene-Modified Carbon Electrodes via Electrophoretic Deposition,"Barun Chakrabarti, Javier Rubio-Garcia, Evangelos Kalamaras, Vladimir Yufit, Farid Tariq, Chee Tong John Low, Anthony Kucernak, Nigel Brandon",2020,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries6030038,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/3/38/pdf?version=1594630996,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/6/3/38,27,"Common issues aqueous-based vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) face include low cell voltage due to water electrolysis side reactions and highly corrosive and environmentally unfriendly electrolytes (3 to 5 M sulfuric acid). Therefore, this investigation looks into the comparison of a highly conductive ionic liquid with a well-studied deep eutectic solvent (DES) as electrolytes for non-aqueous VRFBs. The latter solvent gives 50% higher efficiency and capacity utilization than the former. These figures of merit increase by 10% when nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G)-modified carbon papers, via a one-step binder-free electrophoretic deposition process, are used as electrodes. X-ray computed tomography confirms the enhancement of electrochemical surface area of the carbon electrodes due to N-G while electrochemical impedance spectra show the effect of its higher conductivity on improving RFB performance. Finally, potential strategies for the scaling-up of DES-based VRFBs using a simple economical model are also briefly discussed. From this study, it is deduced that more investigations on applying DESs as non-aqueous electrolytes to replace the commonly used acetonitrile may be a positive step forward because DESs are not only cheaper but also safer to handle, far less toxic, non-flammable, and less volatile than acetonitrile.

The goal is to characterize an Li-ion cell and obtain its charging and discharging curves with different current rates and different cycle depths, as well as its transitory response. In addition, the results provided are represented and compared, and different methods of estimating the state of the batteries are applied. They include the dynamics of the electrolyte and the effects of aging caused by a high number of charging and discharging cycles of the batteries.

Furthermore, different test parameters are often investigated individually, but rarely brought together in order to optimize the discharge process and unlock the full discharge capability of an air electrode. In this work, we present a highly porous electrode based on graphite nanosheets (GNS) and discuss the impact of the discharge current density and the oxygen pressure as battery test parameters, as well as the electrolyte salt and volume, on the discharge behavior. In particular, changing the electrolyte salt from LiNO 3 to LiTFSI proved to be an important step towards better cell performance, because synergistic effects of the electrolyte and GNS greatly enhance the carbon-specific capacity. The optimized combination of the aforementioned parameters enabled a remarkably high discharge capacity of 56.3 mAh/cm 2 (5860 mAh/g carbon ) obtained at 150 µA/cm 2 (15.6 mA/g carbon ), resulting in the almost complete conversion of the lithium anode. These experimental results are an important step towards practical high-capacity air electrodes for Li-O 2 batteries. Full article"

In particular, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a significant role in almost all storage application fields, including Electric Vehicles (EVs). Therefore, a full comprehension of the influence of the temperature on the key cell components and their governing equations is mandatory for the effective integration of LIBs into the application. If the battery is exposed to extreme thermal environments or the desired temperature cannot be maintained, the rates of chemical reactions and/or the mobility of the active species may change drastically. The alteration of properties of LIBs with temperature may create at best a performance problem and at worst a safety problem. Despite the presence of many reports on LIBs in the literature, their industrial realization has still been difficult, as the technologies developed in different labs have not been standardized yet. Thus, the field requires a systematic analysis of the effect of temperature on the critical properties of LIBs. In this paper, we report a comprehensive review of the effect of temperature on the properties of LIBs such as performance, cycle life, and safety. In addition, we focus on the alterations in resistances, energy losses, physicochemical properties, and aging mechanism when the temperature of LIBs are not under control. Full article"

This paper presented both laboratory data and simulation results at C-rates of 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C at an ambient temperature of approximately 23 °C. During experiment thermocouples were placed on the surface of the battery. The thermal model assumed constant current discharge and was experimentally validated. It was observed that temperature increased with C-rates at both the surface and the tabs. We note that at 4C the battery temperature increased from 22 °C to 47.40 °C and the tab temperature increased from 22 °C to 52.94 °C. Overall, the simulation results showed that more heat was produced in the cathode than the anode, the primary source of heat was the electrolyte resistance, and the battery temperature was the highest near the tabs and in the internal space of the battery. Simulation of the lithium concentration within the battery showed that the lithium concentration was more uniform in the anode than in the cathode. These results can help the accurate thermal design and thermal management of Li-ion batteries. Full article"

Water-processed LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LMNO) cathode and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) anode coatings with the integration of a thin carbon primer at the interface to the collector were prepared. Despite the fact that the laboratory manufactured PCCF shows a much higher film thickness of 55 µm compared to Al foil of 19 µm, the electrode resistance was measured to be by a factor of 5 lower compared to the Al collector, which was attributed to the low contact resistance between PCCF, carbon primer and electrode microstructure. The PCCF-C-primer collector shows a sufficient voltage stability up to 5 V vs. Li/Li + and a negligible Li-intercalation loss into the carbon primer. Electrochemical cell tests demonstrate the applicability of the developed PCCF for LMNO and LTO electrodes, with no disadvantage compared to state-of-the-art Al collector. Due to a 50% lower material density, the lightweight and hermetic dense PCCF polymer collector offers the possibility to significantly decrease the mass loading of the collector in battery cells, which can be of special interest for bipolar battery architectures.

The stability of each component in the battery is the key to long service life. To evaluate the stability of the carbon component, we introduce here a quick and direct testing method. LiMn 2 O 4 is chosen as a typical active material for the preparation of the cathode, with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF), and a commercial carbon, which is chosen among Acetylene black, superP, superP-Li, Ketjen black 1, Ketjen black 2, Graphite, KS-6, splintered glassy carbon, and splintered spherical carbon. This method reveals the correlation between the electrochemical stability of a carbon and its physical and structural properties. This helps researchers choose the right carbon component for a Li-ion cathode if they want the battery to be robust, especially at near full state of charge. Full article"

To secure its supply in future, it is utmost important to recover cobalt efficiently from industrial wastes and recycled End-of-Life batteries. This study aims at finding ways to improve the reduction of cobalt as well as valuable metals nickel and copper in nickel slag cleaning furnace conditions by using both traditional fossil-based coke and a more sustainable option, low-CO 2 footprint biochar, as reductants. A cobalt-rich fraction of battery scrap (25.5 wt% Co) was also used as a secondary feed. The experimental technique consisted of reduction experiments with different times at 1400 °C under inert atmosphere, quick quenching and Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis. The use of biochar resulted in faster reaction kinetics in the reduction process, compared to coke. Moreover, the presence of battery scrap had a clear impact on the behavior and reduction kinetics of the elements and/or enhanced settling and separation of matte and slag. The addition of scrap increased notably the distribution coefficients of the valuable metals but consequently also the iron concentration in matte which is the thermodynamic constraint of the slag cleaning process.

This study utilised two tests–(i) to establish the maximum current limits before cell failure and (ii) applying this maximum current until cell failure. Testing was performed to determine how far cycling parameters could progress beyond the manufacturer’s recommendations. Current fluxes were increased up to 100 C cycling conditions without the cell undergoing catastrophic failure. Charge and discharge current capabilities were possible at magnitudes of 1.38 and 4.4 times, respectively, more than that specified by the manufacturer’s claims. The increased current was used for longer term cycling tests to 500 cycles and the resulting capacity loss and resistance increase was dominated by thermal fatigue of the electrodes. This work shows that there is a discrepancy between manufacturer-stated current limits and actual current limits of the cell, before the cell undergoes catastrophic failure. This presumably is based on manufacturer-defined performance and lifetime criteria, as well as prioritised safety factors. For certain applications, e.g., where high performance is needed, this gap may not be suitable; this paper shows how this gap could be narrowed for these applications using the testing described herein.

The simulation results of the BESS installation were evaluated in the IEEE 33-bus distribution network. Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) were adopted to solve this optimization problem, and the results obtained from these two algorithms were compared.

Previous research found that it varies in a nonlinear manner with respect to the voltage. However, none of them modeled the capacitance evolution while considering the physicochemical phenomena that happen in a LiC cell. This paper focuses on developing a new capacitance model that is based on the Stern model of the electrochemical double layer capacitance. The model accounts for the asymmetric V-shape of the C(V) curve, which reflects the variation of the capacitance with respect to the voltage. The novelty of this study concerns the development of a model for LiCs that relies on the fundamental theory of Stern for the differential capacitance. The basic model of Stern is modified in order to account for the hybrid physicochemical structure of LiCs. Moreover, the model was applied to three aged cells to which accelerated calendar aging tests were applied at three voltage values: 2.2, 3 and 3.8 V. A drift of the voltage corresponding to the minimum capacitance was detected for the aged cells. This voltage is related to the neutral state of the positive electrode. The main cause of this phenomenon concerns the loss of lithium ions from the negative electrode of a LiC. In addition, capacitance values decreased after aging, showing an eventual blocking of the pores of the positive electrode. Therefore, the analysis of the C(V) curve was found to be an interesting tool for the interpretation of aging mechanisms. Full article"

The interconnection between a workshop system and equipment is the basis for realizing manufacturing informatization and intelligence, and is a core problem of intelligent manufacturing workshop integration. The key to solve this problem is to establish a standardized and consistent information model. Aiming at the problem of information interconnection, this paper established an information model of the intelligent manufacturing workshop of lithium ion batteries based on the analysis of the architecture, functional categories, and information interaction of the intelligent manufacturing workshop. Then, by clarifying the attribute set, component set, and the information objects contained in each information model, the hierarchical architecture of the information model was constructed.

However, the electrochemical performance, particularly for mesoporous TiO 2 , is limited and must be further developed. Elemental doping is a viable route to enhance rate capability and discharge capacity of TiO 2 anodes in Li-ion batteries. Usually, elemental doping requires elevated temperatures, which represents a challenge, particularly for sulfur as a dopant. In this work, S-doped TiO 2 nanotubes were successfully synthesized in situ during the electrochemical anodization of a titanium substrate at room temperature. The electrochemical anodization bath represented an ethylene glycol-based solution containing NH 4 F along with Na 2 S 2 O 5 as the sulfur source. The S-doped TiO 2 anodes demonstrated a higher areal discharge capacity of 95 µAh·cm −2 at a current rate of 100 µA·cm −2 after 100 cycles, as compared to the pure TiO 2 nanotubes (60 µAh·cm −2 ). S-TiO 2 also exhibited a significantly improved rate capability up to 2500 µA·cm −2 as compared to undoped TiO 2 . The improved electrochemical performance, as compared to pure TiO 2 nanotubes, is attributed to a lower impedance in S-doped TiO 2 nanotubes (STNTs). Thus, the direct S-doping during the anodization process is a promising and cost-effective route towards improved TiO 2 anodes for Li-ion batteries. Full article"

This plays a critical role, especially for industrial devices with low-power demands planned for long lasting operation. While cost limitation mostly leads to use of the low-budget batteries with fast degradation, a model of these batteries supplying low-power loads is provided here. The overall model is in open-loop form because no access to the terminal measurements is available during the design phase. The identification process of the relation between the state of charge and related electromotive force as a key element of the model is discussed. Moreover, guidelines are suggested for identification of this relation. Furthermore, SoC estimation based on the Coulomb counting is modified to include a dynamic inter-cycle aging factor. This factor enables replication of the degradation within a single cycle. In spite of simplicity of this concept, it is able to reduce the model’s estimation error evaluated with two different types of loads. The overall model provides promising results with relative errors less than 0.2%. Full article"

Electron transfer rate ( k 0 ) increased by an order of magnitude (10 −6 ms −1 to 10 −8 ms −1 ) for each H 2 SO 4 concentrations investigated (1, 3 and 5 M). Analysis of cyclic voltammetry switching currents suggests that the technique might be suitable for fast determination of state of charge if the system is well calibrated. Membrane uptake and permeability measurements show that vanadium absorption and crossover is more dependent on both acid and vanadium concentration than state of charge. Vanadium diffusion in the membrane is about an order of magnitude slower (~10 −11 m 2 s −1 ) than in solution (~10 −10 m 2 s −1 ). Full article"

Citric acid (CA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were employed to synthesize the nanostructured NASICON-type Li 1.4 Al 0.4 Ti 1.6 (PO 4 ) 3 ceramic. The chelating agent, together with an ethylene glycol (EG) and the esterification agent were employed to form a network decorated with uniform dispersed metal ions under specific conditions: molar ratio [complexing agent/metal ions] = 1 and the molar ratio [EG/EDTA] = 6, whereas the solution pH was kept below 1. A well crystalline NASICON structure was formed following the heat treatment of the produced gel at 630 °C. Simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) revealed lower required temperature for pyrolysis and crystallization using EDTA. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) showed the formation of larger crystallite size when citric acid was employed. The data from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have confirmed the higher apparent porosity and a larger proportion of grain boundaries in the case of EDTA-assisted synthesis.

Impact of Test Conditions While Screening Lithium-Ion Batteries for Capacity Degradation in Low Earth Orbit CubeSat Space Applications,"Riley Cook, Lukas Swan, Kevin Plucknett",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7010020,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/20/pdf?version=1615805895,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/20,8,"A wide variety of commercial cylindrical lithium-ion batteries are available for use in nanosatellites (CubeSats) that cycle in low Earth orbit (LEO). This space application differs greatly from the conditions used to create the manufacturer datasheets that CubeSat teams rely on to screen cell types and estimate performance lifetimes. To address this, we experimentally test three LIB cell types using a representative LEO CubeSat power profile in three progressively complex test representations of LEO. The first is “standardized” condition (101 kPa-abs, 20 °C), which uses only a power cycler; the second adds a thermal chamber for “low temperature” condition (101 kPa-abs, 10 °C); and the third adds a vacuum chamber for “LEO” condition (0.2 kPa-abs, 10 °C). Results indicate that general “standardized” and “low temperature” conditions do not yield representative results to what would occur in LEO. Coincidentally, the “LEO” condition gives similar capacity degradation results as manufacturer datasheets. This was an unexpected finding, but suggests that CubeSat teams use full experimental thermal-vacuum testing or default to the manufacturer datasheet performance estimates during the lithium-ion cell screening and selection process. The use of a partial representation of the LEO condition is not recommended. Full article"

Great demands are being placed on the quality of battery cells and their electrochemical properties. Therefore, the understanding of interactions between products and processes and the implementation of quality management measures are essential factors that requires inline capable process monitoring. In battery cell lamination processes, a typical problem source of quality issues can be seen in missing or misaligned components (anodes, cathodes and separators). An automatic detection of missing or misaligned components, however, has not been established thus far. In this study, acoustic measurements to detect components in battery cell lamination were applied. Although the use of acoustic measurement methods for process monitoring has already proven its usefulness in various fields of application, it has not yet been applied to battery cell production. While laminating battery electrodes and separators, acoustic emissions were recorded. Signal analysis and machine learning techniques were used to acoustically distinguish the individual components that have been processed. This way, the detection of components with a balanced accuracy of up to 83% was possible, proving the feasibility of the concept as an inline capable monitoring system. Full article"
A Performance and Cost Overview of Selected Solid-State Electrolytes: Race between Polymer Electrolytes and Inorganic Sulfide Electrolytes,"Duygu Karabelli, Kai Peter Birke, Max Weeber",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7010018,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/18/pdf?version=1614928637,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/18,81,"Electrolytes are key components in electrochemical storage systems, which provide an ion-transport mechanism between the cathode and anode of a cell. As battery technologies are in continuous development, there has been growing demand for more efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly materials. Solid-state lithium ion batteries (SSLIBs) are considered as next-generation energy storage systems and solid electrolytes (SEs) are the key components for these systems. Compared to liquid electrolytes, SEs are thermally stable (safer), less toxic and provide a more compact (lighter) battery design. However, the main issue is the ionic conductivity, especially at low temperatures. So far, there are two popular types of SEs: (1) inorganic solid electrolytes (InSEs) and (2) polymer electrolytes (PEs). Among InSEs, sulfide-based SEs are providing very high ionic conductivities (up to 10 −2 S/cm) and they can easily compete with liquid electrolytes (LEs). On the other hand, they are much more expensive than LEs. PEs can be produced at less cost than InSEs but their conductivities are still not sufficient for higher performances. This paper reviews the most efficient SEs and compares them in terms of their performances and costs. The challenges associated with the current state-of-the-art electrolytes and their cost-reduction potentials are described. Full article"

The frequency-dependent pseudocapacitance at 0.15 Hz is presented as useful state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) indicator. For the same battery type, the prediction error of pseudocapacitance is better than 1% for a quadratic calibration curve, and less than 36% for a linear model. An approximately linear correlation between pseudocapacitance and Ah battery capacity is observed as long as overcharge and deep discharge are avoided. We verify the impedance method in comparison to the classical constant-current discharge measurements. In the case of five examined lithium-ion chemistries, the linear trend of impedance and SOC is lost if the slope of the discharge voltage curve versus SOC changes. With nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), high impedance modulus correlates with high SOC above 70%. Full article"

The abundantly available precursors and environmental friendliness are generating more and more interest in sodium ion batteries (SIBs), especially because of the lower material costs compared to Li-ion batteries. Therefore, significant efforts are being dedicated to investigating new cathode materials for SIBs. Since the thermal characterization of cathode materials is one of the key factors for designing safe batteries, the thermophysical properties of a commercial layered P2 type structure Na 0.53 MnO 2 cathode material in powder form were measured in the temperature range between −20 and 1200 °C by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), laser flash analysis (LFA), and thermogravimetry (TG). The thermogravimetry (TG) was combined with mass spectrometry (MS) to study the thermal decomposition of the cathode material with respect to the evolved gas analysis (EGA) and was performed from room temperature up to 1200 °C. The specific heat ( C p ) and the thermal diffusivity (α) were measured up to 400 °C because beyond this temperature, the cathode material starts to decompose. The thermal conductivity (λ) as a function of temperature was calculated from the thermal diffusivity, the specific heat capacity, and the density. Such thermophysical data are highly relevant and important for thermal simulation studies, thermal management, and the mitigation of thermal runaway. Full article"

Due to their perishable nature, it is crucial to supervise them closely. In addition to on-board supervision over safety and range, insights into the battery’s degradation are also becoming increasingly important, not only for the vehicle manufacturers but also for vehicle users. The concept of digital twins has already emerged on the field of automotive technology, and can also help to digitalize the vehicle’s battery. In this work, we set up a data pipeline and digital battery twin to track the battery state, including State of charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH). To achieve this goal, we reverse-engineer the diagnostics interface of a 2014 e-Golf to query for UDS messages containing both battery pack and cell-individual data. An OBD logger records the data with edge-processing capability. Pushing this data into the cloud twin system using IoT-technology, we can fit battery models to the data and infer for example, cell individual internal resistance from them. We find that the resistances of the cells differ by a magnitude of two. Furthermore, we propose an architecture for the battery twin in which the twin fleet shares resources like models by encapsulating them in Docker containers run on a cloud stack. By using web technology, we present the analyzed results on a web interface. Full article"

Thus, there is a need for the availability of transparent information on resource allocation. Battery manufacturing process details in this regard are not available in academia or the public. The available energy data on manufacturing has a high variation. Furthermore, different process steps have different energy and material demands. A process model can benchmark the energy usage, provide detailed process data, and compare various cell productions which in turn can be used in life-cycle assessment studies to reduce the variation and provide directions for improvements. Therefore, a cell manufacturing model is developed for the calculation of energy and material demands for different battery types, plant capacities, and process steps. The model consists of the main process steps, machines, intermediate products and building service units. Furthermore, the results are validated using literature values. For a case study of a 2 GWh plant that produces prismatic NMC333 cells, the total energy requirement on a theoretical and optimal basis is suggested to be [Math Processing Error] 44.6 W h in production / W h cell capacity . This energy consumption in producing batteries is dominated by electrode drying, and dry room. Energy usage for a variety of cell types for a similar plant capacity shows that the standard deviation in the results is low ( [Math Processing Error] 47.23 ± 13.03 W h / W h ). Full article"

The uncoordinated fast charging of BESS in Grid to Ferry (G2F) mode imposes sudden increments of load in the power grid, which is analyzed by a simulated model of grid connected marine load. The probable impact on system stability is examined by MATLAB Simulink and Power World Simulator based models. According to simulation results for IEEE 5 bus system, voltage unbalance factors are 0.01% and 200% for all buses at fundamental and third harmonics frequencies, respectively. The total harmonic distortion (THD) at fundamental frequency becomes 0.16%, 0.16%, and 0.18%, respectively, for three cases. The transient, voltage reactive power (V-Q), and voltage real power (V-P) sensitivity analysis are performed for 7 bus system with load increment contingencies. According to simulation results, the V-Q sensitivity for the assigned contingency is increased by the addition of a shunt generator to the load bus with lowest bus voltage. In case of V-P sensitivity for the selected contingency, the load buses share power among them, and the nose point is attained at maximum shift of power with high V-Q sensitivity. Full article"

However, this kind of end-of-life threshold does not capture the application and battery characteristics and, consequently, it has a low accuracy in describing the real end-of-life event. This paper proposes a systematic methodology to determine the end-of-life threshold that describes accurately the end-of-life event. The proposed methodology can be divided into three phases. In the first phase, the health indicators that represent the aging behavior of the battery are defined. In the second phase, the application specifications and battery characteristics are evaluated to generate the end-of-life criteria. Finally, in the third phase, the simulation environment used to calculate the end-of-life threshold is designed. In this third phase, the electric-thermal behavior of the battery at different aging conditions is simulated using an electro-thermal equivalent circuit model. The proposed methodology is applied to a high-energy electric vehicle application and to a high-power electric vehicle application. The stated hypotheses and the calculated end-of-life threshold of the high-energy application are empirically validated. The study shows that commonly assumed 80 or 70% EOL thresholds could lead to mayor under or over lifespan estimations. Full article"
Infiltrated and Isostatic Laminated NCM and LTO Electrodes with Plastic Crystal Electrolyte Based on Succinonitrile for Lithium-Ion Solid State Batteries,"Matthias Coeler, Vanessa van Laack, Frederieke Langer, Annegret Potthoff, Sören Höhn, Sebastian Reuber, Katharina Koscheck, Mareike Wolter",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7010011,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/11/pdf?version=1612348786,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/11,11,"We report a new process technique for electrode manufacturing for all solid-state batteries. Porous electrodes are manufactured by a tape casting process and subsequently infiltrated by a plastic crystal polymer electrolyte (PCPE). With a following isostatic lamination process, the PCPE was further integrated deeply into the porous electrode layer, forming a composite electrode. The PCPE comprises the plastic crystal succinonitrile (SN), lithium conductive salt LiTFSI and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and exhibits suitable thermal, rheological (ƞ = 0.6 Pa s @ 80 °C 1 s −1 ) and electrochemical properties (σ > 10 −4 S/cm @ 45 °C). We detected a lowered porosity of infiltrated and laminated electrodes through Hg porosimetry, showing a reduction from 25.6% to 2.6% (NCM infiltrated to laminated) and 32.9% to 4.0% (LTO infiltrated to laminated). Infiltration of PCPE into the electrodes was further verified by FESEM images and EDS mapping of sulfur content of the conductive salt. Cycling tests of full cells with NCM and LTO electrodes with PCPE separator at 45 °C showed up to 165 mAh/g at 0.03C over 20 cycles, which is about 97% of the total usable LTO capacity with a coulomb efficiency of between 98 and 99%. Cycling tests at 0.1C showed a capacity of ~128 mAh/g after 40 cycles. The C-rate of 0.2C showed a mean capacity of 127 mAh/g. In summary, we could manufacture full cells using a plastic crystal polymer electrolyte suitable for NCM and LTO active material, which is easily to be integrated into porous electrodes and which is being able to be used in future cell concepts like bipolar stacked cells.

In order to obtain reliable parameters to evaluate and classify the cells, it is essential to design the test procedures in such a way that the parameters derived from the data allow the required statements about the cells. Before the focus is placed on the evaluation of cell properties, it is therefore necessary to design the test procedures appropriately. In the scope of the investigations two differently designed incoming inspection routines were carried out on 230 commercial lithium-ion battery cells (LIBs) with the aim of deriving recommendations for optimal test procedures. The derived parameters of the test strategies were compared and statistically evaluated. Subsequently, key figures for the classification were identified. As a conclusion, the capacity was confirmed as an already known important parameter and the average cell voltage was identified as a possibility to replace the usually used internal resistance. With regard to capacity, the integration of CV steps in the discharging processes enables the determination independently from the C-rate. For the average voltage cycles with high C-rates are particularly meaningful because of the significant higher scattering due to the overvoltage parts. Full article"

Currently, the available vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) models achieve highly accurate predictions of electrochemical behavior or control algorithms, while the optimization of the required input data scope is neglected. In this study, a parametrization tool for a DC grey box simulation model is developed using measurements with a 10 kW/100 kWh VRFB. An objective function is applied to optimize the required input data scope while analyzing simulation accuracy. The model is based on a differential-algebraic system, and an optimization process allows model parameter estimation and verification while reducing the input data scope. Current losses, theoretical storage capacity, open circuit voltage, and ohmic cell resistance are used as fitting parameters. Internal electrochemical phenomena are represented by a self-discharge current while material related losses are represented by a changing ohmic resistance. Upon reducing input data the deviation between the model and measurements shows an insignificant increase of 2% even for a 60% input data reduction. The developed grey box model is easily adaptable to other VRFB and is highly integrable into an existing energy architecture. Full article"
Effects of the Nail Geometry and Humidity on the Nail Penetration of High-Energy Density Lithium Ion Batteries,"Stefan Doose, Wolfgang Haselrieder, Arno Kwade",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7010006,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/6/pdf?version=1610539511,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/6,21,"Internal short-circuit tests were carried out in a battery safety investigation chamber to determine the behavior of batteries during the nail penetration test. So far, systematic investigations regarding the test setup and its influence are rarely found in the literature. Especially, to improve the comparability of the multitude of available results, it is essential to understand the effects of the geometric, operating and ambient parameters. In this study commercial lithium ion batteries with a capacity of 5.3 and 3.3 Ah were used to study the influence of the varied parameters on the voltage drop, the development of surface temperatures and of infrared active gas species. We studied both the influence of the geometry of the penetrating nail and concentration of water in the inert atmosphere especially on the quantities of the reaction products under variation of cell capacity. It could be shown that the geometry of the nail, within certain limits, has no influence on the processes of the thermal runaway of high energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, a change in capacity from 5.3 to 3.3 Ah shows that in particular the gaseous reaction products differ: The standardized gas concentrations show a higher measurable concentration of all gases except CO for the 3.3 Ah LIBs. This circumstance can be explained by the intensity of the reactions due to the different battery capacities: In the 5.3 Ah cells a larger amount of unreacted material is immediately discharged from the reaction center, and by the different available amounts of oxidizing reaction partners. An increase of the water content in the surrounding atmosphere during the thermal runaway leads to a reduction of the measurable gas concentrations of up to 36.01%. In general, all measured concentrations decrease. With increased water content more reaction products from the atmosphere can be directly bound or settle as condensate on surfaces. Full article"

The electroactivity of TiHCF as a host for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries is studied in organic electrolytes. The results demonstrate that TiHCF is a good positive electrode material for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Surprisingly, however, the material shows better electrochemical performance as a Na-ion host, offering a capacity of 74 mAh g −1 at C/20 and a 94.5% retention after 50 cycles. This is due to the activation of Ti towards the redox reaction, making TiHCF a good candidate electrode material for Na-ion batteries. Full article"

By using specific charging procedures based on negative electrode performance, as opposed to the industrial standard constant current constant voltage procedures, we show that the cells with a higher N:P ratio can be charged to ~16% higher capacity in the ten-minute time frame. Cells with a higher N:P ratio also show similar cycle life performance to those with a conventional N:P ratio, despite the fact that these cells experience a much higher irreversible capacity loss, leading to a lower reversible specific capacity.

Traditional liquid electrolytes prove precarious in large scale schemes due to the propensity for leakage, the potential for side reactions and their corrosive nature. Alternative electrolytic materials in the form of solid inorganic ion conductors and solid polymer matrices offer new possibilities for all solid state batteries. In addition to the engineering of novel electrolyte materials, there is the opportunity to employ post-lithium chemistries.

Effect of Vinylene Carbonate Electrolyte Additive on the Surface Chemistry and Pseudocapacitive Sodium-Ion Storage of TiO2Nanosheet Anodes,"Rudi Ruben Maça, Vinodkumar Etacheri",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7010001,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/1/pdf?version=1608803829,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/1/1,17,"Although titanium dioxide has gained much attention as a sodium-ion battery anode material, obtaining high specific capacity and cycling stability remains a challenge. Herein, we report significantly improved surface chemistry and pseudocapacitive Na-ion storage performance of TiO 2 nanosheet anode in vinylene carbonate (VC)-containing electrolyte solution. In addition to the excellent pseudocapacitance (~87%), the TiO 2 anodes also exhibited increased high-specific capacity (219 mAh/g), rate performance (40 mAh/g @ 1 A/g), coulombic efficiency (~100%), and cycling stability (~90% after 750 cycles). Spectroscopic and microscopic studies confirmed polycarbonate based solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation in VC-containing electrolyte solution. The superior electrochemical performance of the TiO 2 nanosheet anode in VC-containing electrolyte solution is credited to the improved pseudocapacitive Na-ion diffusion through the polycarbonate based SEI (coefficients of 1.65 × 10 −14 for PC-VC vs. 6.42 × 10 −16 for PC). This study emphasizes the crucial role of the electrolyte solution and electrode–electrolyte interfaces in the improved pseudocapacitive Na-ion storage performance of TiO 2 anodes. Full article"
Absolute Local Quantification of Li as Function of State-of-Charge in All-Solid-State Li Batteries via 2D MeV Ion-Beam Analysis,"Sören Möller, Takahiro Satoh, Yasuyuki Ishii, Britta Teßmer, Rayan Guerdelli, Tomihiro Kamiya, Kazuhisa Fujita, Kota Suzuki, Yoshiaki Kato, Hans-Dieter Wiemhöfer, Kunioki Mima, Martin Finsterbusch",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020041,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/41/pdf?version=1624195953,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/41,8,"Direct observation of the lithiation and de-lithiation in lithium batteries on the component and microstructural scale is still difficult. This work presents recent advances in MeV ion-beam analysis, enabling quantitative contact-free analysis of the spatially-resolved lithium content and state-of-charge (SoC) in all-solid-state lithium batteries via 3 MeV proton-based characteristic x-ray and gamma-ray emission analysis. The analysis is demonstrated on cross-sections of ceramic and polymer all-solid-state cells with LLZO and MEEP/LIBOB solid electrolytes. Different SoC are measured ex-situ and one polymer-based operando cell is charged at 333 K during analysis. The data unambiguously show the migration of lithium upon charging. Quantitative lithium concentrations are obtained by taking the physical and material aspects of the mixed cathodes into account. This quantitative lithium determination as a function of SoC gives insight into irreversible degradation phenomena of all-solid-state batteries during the first cycles and locations of immobile lithium. The determined SoC matches the electrochemical characterization within uncertainties. The presented analysis method thus opens up a completely new access to the state-of-charge of battery cells not depending on electrochemical measurements. Automated beam scanning and data-analysis algorithms enable a 2D quantitative Li and SoC mapping on the µm-scale, not accessible with other methods. Full article"
Comparison of Aqueous- and Non-Aqueous-Based Binder Polymers and the Mixing Ratios for Zn//MnO2Batteries with Mildly Acidic Aqueous Electrolytes,"Oliver Fitz, Stefan Ingenhoven, Christian Bischoff, Harald Gentischer, Kai Peter Birke, Dragos Saracsan, Daniel Biro",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020040,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/40/pdf?version=1624235470,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/40,18,"Considering the literature for aqueous rechargeable Zn//MnO 2 batteries with acidic electrolytes using the doctor blade coating of the active material (AM), carbon black (CB), and binder polymer (BP) for the positive electrode fabrication, different binder types with (non-)aqueous solvents were introduced so far. Furthermore, in most of the cases, relatively high passive material (CB+BP) shares ~30 wt% were applied. The first part of this work focuses on different selected BPs: polyacrylonitrile (PAN), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), cellulose acetate (CA), and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR). They were used together with (non-)aqueous solvents: DI-water, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). By performing mechanical, electrochemical and optical characterizations, a better overall performance of the BPs using aqueous solvents was found in aqueous 2 M ZnSO 4 + 0.1 M MnSO 4 electrolyte (i.e., BP LA133 : 150 mAh·g −1 and 189 mWh·g −1 @ 160 mA·g −1 ). The second part focuses on the mixing ratio of the electrode components, aiming at the decrease of the commonly used passive material share of ~30 wt% for an industrial-oriented electrode fabrication, while still maintaining the electrochemical performance. Here, the absolute CB share and the CB/BP ratio are found to be important parameters for an application-oriented electrode fabrication (i.e., high energy/power applications). Full article"
Methodology for Determining Time-Dependent Lead Battery Failure Rates from Field Data,"Rafael Conradt, Frederic Heidinger, Kai Peter Birke",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020039,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/39/pdf?version=1623825602,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/39,10,"The safety requirements in vehicles continuously increase due to more automated functions using electronic components. Besides the reliability of the components themselves, a reliable power supply is crucial for a safe overall system. Different architectures for a safe power supply consider the lead battery as a backup solution for safety-critical applications. Various ageing mechanisms influence the performance of the battery and have an impact on its reliability. In order to qualify the battery with its specific failure modes for use in safety-critical applications, it is necessary to prove this reliability by failure rates. Previous investigations determine the fixed failure rates of lead batteries using data from teardown analyses to identify the battery failure modes but did not include the lifetime of these batteries examined. Alternatively, lifetime values of battery replacements in workshops without knowing the reason for failure were used to determine the overall time-dependent failure rate. This study presents a method for determining reliability models of lead batteries by investigating individual failure modes. Since batteries are subject to ageing, the analysis of lifetime values of different failure modes results in time-dependent failure rates of different magnitudes. The failure rates of the individual failure modes develop with different shapes over time, which allows their ageing behaviour to be evaluated. Full article"
A Comparison of Lithium-Ion Cell Performance across Three Different Cell Formats,"Grace Bridgewater, Matthew J. Capener, James Brandon, Michael J.

Coin cells, single layer pouch cells, and stacked pouch cells gave a range of scales of almost three orders of magnitude. The cells used the same electrode coatings, electrolyte and separator. The performance of the different formats was compared in long term cycling tests and in measurements of resistance and discharge capacities at different rates. Some test results were common to all three formats. However, the stacked pouch cells had higher discharge capacities at higher rates. During cycling tests, there were indications of differences in the predominant degradation mechanism between the stacked cells and the other two cell formats. The stacked cells showed faster resistance increases, whereas the coin cells showed faster capacity loss. The difference in degradation mechanism can be linked to the different thermal and mechanical environments in the three cell formats. The correlation in the electrochemical performance between coin cells, single layer pouch cells, and stacked pouch cells shows that developments within a single cell format are likely to lead to improvements across all cell formats.

Methodology for the Optimisation of Battery Hybrid Energy Storage Systems for Mass and Volume Using a Power-To-Energy Ratio Analysis,"Gregory Tzermias, Sam Akehurst, Richard Burke, Chris Brace, Sunoj George, Johan Bernards, Christopher Smith",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020037,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/37/pdf?version=1622703455,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/37,13,"Increasingly stringent emission regulations and environmental concerns have propelled the development of electrification technology in the transport industry. Yet, the greatest hurdle to developing fully electric vehicles is electrochemical energy storage, which struggles to achieve profitable specific power, specific energy and cost targets. Hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), which combine energy- and power-optimised sources, seem to be the most promising solution for improving the overall performance of energy storage. The potential for gravimetric and volumetric reduction is strictly dependent on the overall power-to-energy ratio (PE ratio) of the application, packaging factors, the minimum and maximum PE ratio achievable for the system’s energy- and power-optimised sources and the performance of power electronics. This paper presents a simple optimisation methodology that considers these factors and identifies the optimal HESS requirements that may present new opportunities for a variety of vehicles where low weight and volume are of high importance. The simplicity of the method means that decisions relating to a HESS can be made earlier in the system design process. This method of analysis showed that a battery HESS has the potential to reduce cell mass and volume by over 30% for applications that are well suited to optimal HESS characteristics. Full article"
Determination of the Distribution of Relaxation Times by Means of Pulse Evaluation for Offline and Online Diagnosis of Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Erik Goldammer, Julia Kowal",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020036,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/36/pdf?version=1622539821,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/36,38,"The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis of impedance spectra is a proven method to determine the number of occurring polarization processes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), their polarization contributions and characteristic time constants. Direct measurement of a spectrum by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), however, suffers from a high expenditure of time for low-frequency impedances and a lack of general availability in most online applications. In this study, a method is presented to derive the DRT by evaluating the relaxation voltage after a current pulse. The method was experimentally validated using both EIS and the proposed pulse evaluation to determine the DRT of automotive pouch-cells and an aging study was carried out. The DRT derived from time domain data provided improved resolution of processes with large time constants and therefore enabled changes in low-frequency impedance and the correlated degradation mechanisms to be identified. One of the polarization contributions identified could be determined as an indicator for the potential risk of plating. The novel, general approach for batteries was tested with a sampling rate of 10 Hz and only requires relaxation periods. Therefore, the method is applicable in battery management systems and contributes to improving the reliability and safety of LIBs. Full article"

Firstly, we provide a set of already existing quantitative and qualitative metrics that rate the relevant aspects of the performance of a stochastic prognosis algorithm. Secondly, we provide innovative guidelines to detect and minimize the effect of side aspects that interact on the algorithms’ performance. Those aspects are related with the input uncertainty (the uncertainty on the data and the prior knowledge), the parametrization method and the uncertainty propagation method. The proposed evaluation framework is contextualized on a Lithium-ion battery Remaining Useful Life prognosis problem. As an example, a Particle Filter is evaluated. On this example, two different data sets taken from NCA aged batteries and two semi-empirical aging models available in the literature fed up the Particle Filter under evaluation. The obtained results show that the proposed framework gives enough details to take decisions about the viability of the chosen algorithm. Full article"

All experiments were carried out using model NaCl solutions with a concentration of 40 g/L for 150 min. The results of the experiment were that the NaOH concentration, conductivity, and pH presented an increasing linear trend with the electrolysis time.

These desired characteristics include energy density, rate capability, and cycle life. The samples were prepared using three approaches, and the same sol-gel synthesis procedure is applied to obtain phase-pure samples and keep the structural properties similar. The influence of these methods on the LTO anodes was then explored in both half-cell and full-cell LIC devices with an activated carbon (AC) cathode. It was observed that the samples had similar specific capacities and energy densities at low specific currents. However, significant differences were observed in the samples’ morphological properties, the rate capability, and the full-cell cycle life performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to identify the electrochemical kinetics and revealed that the LIC with the best performance was influenced by the LTO anode having the least charge transfer and diffusion resistances prepared using a surfactant. This was due to the small particle size, good particle dispersion, and high specific surface area of the LTO anode. This result points to the importance of the choice of synthesis technique in LIC material’s overall performance. Full article"

A precise suitability test at the beginning of the second life is therefore necessary. Common methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and current interrupt (CI) analysis, as well as capacity analysis, can be used for testing. In this paper, these methods are studied from the aspects of test duration, sensitivity and acquisition costs of the measuring instruments. For this purpose, tests are carried out on battery modules, which were used for transportation. It is shown that subtle differences are better detected with EIS and less accurately with the CI method. The test duration is fastest with the CI method, followed by EIS and the capacity test. Strongly aged modules are reliably detected with all methods. Full article"

Cell-level hardware allows for advanced battery state monitoring and thermal management, but also leads to additional thermal interactions. In this work, an electro-thermal framework for the modeling of these novel intelligent battery cells is provided. Thereby, a lumped thermal model, as well as a novel neural network, are implemented in the framework as thermal submodels. For the first time, a direct comparison of a physics-based and a data-driven thermal battery model is performed in the same framework. The models are compared in terms of temperature estimation with regard to accuracy. Both models are very well suited to represent the thermal behavior in novel intelligent battery cells. In terms of accuracy and computation time, however, the data-driven neural network approach with a Nonlinear AutoregRessive network with eXogeneous input (NARX) shows slight advantages. Finally, novel applications of temperature prediction in battery electric vehicles are presented and the applicability of the models is illustrated. Thereby, the conventional prediction of the state of power is extended by simultaneous temperature prediction. Additionally, temperature forecasting is used for pre-conditioning by advanced cooling system regulation to enable energy efficiency and fast charging. Full article"
Comparative Study of Kilowatt-Scale Vanadium Redox Flow Battery Stacks Designed with Serpentine Flow Fields and Split Manifolds,"Ravendra Gundlapalli, Sreenivas Jayanti",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020030,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/30/pdf?version=1620297674,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/30,19,"A low-pressure drop stack design with minimal shunt losses was explored for vanadium redox flow batteries, which, due to their low energy density, are used invariably in stationary applications. Three kilowatt-scale stacks, having cell sizes in the range of 400 to 1500 cm 2 , were built with thick graphite plates grooved with serpentine flow fields and external split manifolds for electrolyte circulation, and they were tested over a range of current densities and flow rates. The results show that stacks of different cell sizes have different optimal flow rate conditions, but under their individual optimal flow conditions, all three cell sizes exhibit similar electrochemical performance including stack resistivity. Stacks having larger cell sizes can be operated at lower stoichiometric factors, resulting in lower parasitic pumping losses. Further, these can be operated at a fixed flow rate for power variations of ±25% without any significant changes in discharge capacity and efficiency; this is attributed to the use of serpentine flow fields, which ensure uniform distribution of the electrolyte over a range of flow rates and cell sizes.

Global Warming Potential of a New Waterjet-Based Recycling Process for Cathode Materials of Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Leonard Kurz, Mojtaba Faryadras, Ines Klugius, Frederik Reichert, Andreas Scheibe, Matthias Schmidt, Ralf Wörner",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020029,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/29/pdf?version=1619844161,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/29,29,"Due to the increasing demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the need for vehicle battery raw materials is increasing. The traction battery (TB) of an electric vehicle, usually a lithium-ion battery (LIB), represents the largest share of a BEV’s CO 2 footprint. To reduce this carbon footprint sustainably and to keep the raw materials within a closed loop economy, suitable and efficient recycling processes are essential. In this life cycle assessment (LCA), the ecological performance of a waterjet-based direct recycling process with minimal use of resources and energy is evaluated; only the recycling process is considered, waste treatment and credits for by-products are not part of the analysis. Primary data from a performing recycling company were mainly used for the modelling. The study concludes that the recycling of 1 kg of TB is associated with a global warming potential (GWP) of 158 g CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 e). Mechanical removal using a water jet was identified as the main driver of the recycling process, followed by an air purification system. Compared to conventional hydro- or pyrometallurgical processes, this waterjet-based recycling process could be attributed an 8 to 26 times lower GWP. With 10% and 20% reuse of recyclate in new cells, the GWP of TBs could be reduced by 4% and 8%, respectively. It has been shown that this recycling approach can be classified as environmentally friendly. Full article"
Calendar Aging of Li-Ion Cells—Experimental Investigation and Empirical Correlation,"Daniel Werner, Sabine Paarmann, Thomas Wetzel",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020028,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/28/pdf?version=1620472125,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/28,43,"The lifetime of the battery significantly influences the acceptance of electric vehicles. Calendar aging contributes to the limited operating lifetime of lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, its consideration in addition to cyclical aging is essential to understand battery degradation. This study consequently examines the same graphite/NCA pouch cell that was the subject of previously published cyclic aging tests. The cells were aged at different temperatures and states of charge. The self-discharge was continuously monitored, and after each storage period, the remaining capacity and the impedance were measured. The focus of this publication is on the correlation of the measurements. An aging correlation is obtained that is valid for a wide range of temperatures and states of charge. The results show an accelerated capacity fade and impedance rise with increasing temperature, following the law of Arrhenius. However, the obtained data do also indicate that there is no path dependency, i.e., earlier periods at different temperature levels do not affect the present degradation rate. A large impact of the storage state of charge at 100% is evident, whereas the influence is small below 80%. Instead of the commonly applied square root of the time function, our results are in excellent agreement with an exponential function. Full article"
Experimental and Numerical Investigation of the Thermal Performance of a Hybrid Battery Thermal Management System for an Electric Van,"Franck Pra, Jad Al Koussa, Sebastian Ludwig, Carlo M.

In the case of automotive applications, a battery thermal management (BTM) system is required to maintain the temperature of the cells within a prescribed and safe range, and to prevent excessively high thermal gradients within the battery pack. This work documents the assessment of a thermal management system for a battery pack for an electric van, which adopts a combination of active/passive solutions: the battery cells are arranged in a matrix or composite made of expanded graphite and a phase change material (PCM), which can be actively cooled by forced air convection. The thermal dissipation of the cells was predicted based on an equivalent circuit model of the cells (LG Chem MJ1) that was empirically calibrated in a previous study. It resulted that, in order to keep the temperature of the battery pack at or below 40 °C during certain charge/discharge cycles, a purely passive BTM would require a considerable amount of PCM material that would unacceptably increase the battery pack weight. Therefore, the passive solution was combined with an air cooling system that could be activated when necessary. To assess the resulting hybrid BTM concept, CFD simulations were performed and an experimental test setup was built to validate the simulations. In particular, PCM melting and solidification times, the thermal discrepancy among the cells and the melting/solidification temperatures were examined. The melting time experimentally observed was higher than that predicted by the CFD model, but this discrepancy was not observed during the solidification of the PCM. This deviation between the CFD model results and the experimental data during PCM melting can be attributed to the thermal losses occurring through the mock-up casing as the heating elements are in direct contact with the external walls of the casing. Moreover, the temperature range over which the PCM solidifies was 6 °C lower than that estimated in the numerical simulations. This occurs because the simple thermodynamic model cannot predict the metastable state of the liquid phase which occurs before the onset of PCM solidification. The mockup was also used to emulate the heat dissipation of the cells during a highway driving cycle of the eVan and the thermal management solution as designed. Results showed that for this mission of the vehicle and starting from an initial temperature of the cells of 40 °C, the battery pack temperature could be maintained below 40 °C over the entire mission by a cooling air flow at 2.5 m/s and at a temperature of 30 °C.

Herein, we report a high-performance lithium-sulfur battery based on multidimensional cathode architecture consisting of nanosulfur, graphene nanoplatelets (2D) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (1D). The ultrasonic synthesis method results in the generation of sulfur nanoparticles and their intercalation into the multilayered graphene nanoplatelets. The optimized multidimensional graphene-sulfur-CNT hybrid cathode (GNS58-CNT10) demonstrated a high specific capacity (1067 mAh g −1 @ 50 mA g −1 ), rate performance (539 @ 1 A g −1 ), coulombic efficiency (~95%) and cycling stability (726 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles @ 200 mA g −1 ) compared to the reference cathode. Superior electrochemical performances are credited to the encapsulation of nanosulfur between the individual layers of graphene nanoplatelets with high electronic conductivity, and effective polysulfide trapping by MWCNT bundles.

In case of a defect inside or outside the cell, serious safety risks are possible including extensive heat generation, toxic and flammable gas generation, and consequently fire and explosion. New regulations (GB 38031-2020) require a warning for passengers at least five minutes before serious incidents. This regulation can hardly be fulfilled with state-of-the-art battery monitoring. In this study, gases produced during battery failure before and during a thermal runaway (TR) are investigated in detail and the use of different gas sensors as early detectors of battery incidents is tested and proposed. The response of several commercially available gas sensors is tested in four battery failure cases: unwanted electrolysis of voltage carrying parts, electrolyte vapor, first venting of the cell and the TR. The experiments show that battery failure detection with gas sensors is possible but depends highly on the failure case. The chosen gas sensor can detect H 2 produced by unwanted electrolysis and electrolyte vapor and gases produced by degassing of state-of-the-art LIBs. The results may contribute significantly to failure detection and improvement of battery safety. Full article"

To improve the efficiency of the negative active material and minimize these processes, external application of multivector field is proposed. Two applications of the multivector field are studied: during negative paste preparation and during formation. It is established that, when applying multivector field during negative paste preparation, the chemical processes proceed more efficiently. The results are better phase composition and crystallinity of the cured paste, thus increasing the capacity of the consequently built lead batteries by 12% on average. The application of a multivector field during the formation of negative active materials in lead batteries has a positive effect on the skeletal structure, the size and shape of the Pb crystals. This ensures longer service life, which is confirmed by the 17.5% Depth of Discharge continuous tests on 12 V/75 Ah batteries. The batteries formed under the influence of external multivector field showed 20% longer cycle life. Based on the experimental result, a most probable mechanism of the influence of the multivector field on the chemical and electrochemical processes in lead batteries during negative paste preparation and formation of negative active masses is proposed.

Since statistically most accidents with EVs happen after about one year of vehicle usage, in particular, the failing behavior of aged cells needs to be investigated. Little information is available in open literature about the influence of aging paths on the failing behavior and especially on the degassing behavior of large automotive LIBs. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of three different aging paths (cyclic at −10 °C and at 45 °C and calendric at 60 °C) on the thermal behavior, the vent gas emission, and the vent gas composition. The results show a clear effect of aging on the failing behavior. The aged cells showed a less violent failing reaction, reduced maximal temperatures, lower amount of produced gas, significantly lower amount of CO in the vent gas, and lower mass loss than fresh cells in the same overtemperature experiments. The results are valuable for the scientific and industrial community dealing with LIBs. Full article"
Float Current Analysis for Fast Calendar Aging Assessment of 18650 Li(NiCoAl)O2/Graphite Cells,"Michael Theiler, Christian Endisch, Meinert Lewerenz",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7020022,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/22/pdf?version=1617938898,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/2/22,24,"Float currents are steady-state self-discharge currents after a transient phase—caused by anode overhang, polarization, etc.—is accomplished. The float current is measured in this study with a standard test bench for five 18650 cells (Samsung 25R) at potentiostatic conditions while the temperature is changed in 5 K steps from 5 °C to 60 °C. The entire test is performed in about 100 days resulting in 12 measurement points per cell potential for an Arrhenius representation. The float current follows the Arrhenius law with an activation energy of about 60 kJ/mol. The capacity loss measured at reference condition shows a high correlation to the results of float currents analysis. In contrast to classical calendar aging tests, the performed float current analysis enables determining the aging rate with high precision down to at least 10 °C. Returning from higher temperatures to 30 °C reference temperature shows reducing float currents at 30 °C for increasing temperature steps that may originate from an hysteresis effect that has to be investigated in future publications.

In this paper, a stochastic model for the prediction of battery cell degradation is presented. The proposed model takes its cue from an approach based on Markov chains, although it is not comparable to a Markov process, as the transition probabilities vary with the number of cycles that the cell has performed. The proposed model can reproduce the abrupt decrease in the capacity that occurs near the end of life condition (80% of the nominal value of the capacity) for the cells analyzed. Furthermore, we illustrate the ability of this model to predict the capacity trend for a lithium-ion cell with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) at the cathode and graphite at the anode, subjected to a life cycle in which there are different aging factors, using the results obtained for cells subjected to single aging factors.

Therefore, the operation of batteries at high ambient temperatures is an important aspect to tackle for stationary storage. In the present work, a comprehensive study of the high temperature stability of redox solutions for vanadium flow batteries was performed. In particular, focus was placed on a comparison between batch and in operando precipitation experiments. It was found that, despite being a widely used method in the literature, caution should be taken when assessing the precipitation through capacity fade due to the large influence of external oxidation and cycling parameters, plausibly leading to an incorrect interpretation of the results. The in operando experiments consistently show a precipitation temperature almost 10–20 °C higher than in the batch tests at a 100% state of charge for the same time lapse. Full article"

One of the most discussed topics in the automotive field is lithium-ion battery packs for electric vehicles and their battery thermal management systems (BTMSs). This work aims to show the most used lithium-ion battery pack cooling methods and technologies with best working temperature ranges together with the best performances. Different cooling methods are presented and discussed, with a focus on the comparison between air-cooling systems and liquid-cooling systems. In this context, a BTMS for cylindrical cells is presented, where the cells are arranged in staggered lines embedded in a solid structure and cooled through forced convection within channels. The thermal behavior of this BTMS is simulated by employing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The effect of the geometry of the BTMS on the cell temperature distribution is obtained. It is shown that the use of materials with additives for the solid structure enhances the performance of the system, giving lower temperatures to the cells. The system is tested with air-cooling and water-cooling, showing that the best performances are obtained with water-cooling in terms of cell packing density and lowest cell temperatures.

Impedance Based Temperature Estimation of Lithium Ion Cells Using Artificial Neural Networks,"Marco Ströbel, Julia Pross-Brakhage, Mike Kopp, Kai Peter Birke",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7040085,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/4/85/pdf?version=1639293691,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/4/85,27,"Tracking the cell temperature is critical for battery safety and cell durability. It is not feasible to equip every cell with a temperature sensor in large battery systems such as those in electric vehicles. Apart from this, temperature sensors are usually mounted on the cell surface and do not detect the core temperature, which can mean detecting an offset due to the temperature gradient. Many sensorless methods require great computational effort for solving partial differential equations or require error-prone parameterization. This paper presents a sensorless temperature estimation method for lithium ion cells using data from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in combination with artificial neural networks (ANNs). By training an ANN with data of 28 cells and estimating the cell temperatures of eight more cells of the same cell type, the neural network (a simple feed forward ANN with only one hidden layer) was able to achieve an estimation accuracy of Δ T = Δ T = 1 K (10 ∘ ∘ C < T < < T < 60 ∘ ∘ C) with low computational effort. The temperature estimations were investigated for different cell types at various states of charge (SoCs) with different superimposed direct currents. Our method is easy to use and can be completely automated, since there is no significant offset in monitoring temperature. In addition, the prospect of using the above mentioned approach to estimate additional battery states such as SoC and state of health (SoH) is discussed. Full article"

The increased production of lithium-ion batteries raises concerns over the availability of raw materials, especially cobalt for batteries with nickel-rich cathodes, in which these constraints can impact the high price of cobalt. The reliance on cobalt in these cathodes is worrisome because it is a high-cost, rare material, with an unstable supply chain. This review describes the need and feasibility of developing cobalt-free high-nickel cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The new type of cathode material, LiNi 1−x−y Mn x Al y O 2 promises a completely cobalt-free composition with almost the same electrochemical performance as that of the conventional high-nickel cathode.

The use in redox flow batteries is one of the most important applications of these solutions. Specifically, in this paper we investigated high-concentrated copper chloro-complexes solutions with different additives. The concentration of ligands and additives affects the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of 2 M solutions of Cu(I) and Cu(II). Solutions with calcium chloride and HCl as Cl − source were investigated with Cu:Cl ratios of 1:5 and 1:7, the 1:5 Cu:Cl ratio being the best performing. The substitution of calcium chloride with ammonium chloride increased the conductivity. However, while the effect on the positive electrode process was not very evident, the reversibility of the copper deposition–stripping process was greatly improved. Orthophosphoric acid could be a viable additive to decrease the complexation of calcium with chloride anions and to improve the stability of Cu(II) chloro-complexes. Absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that phosphate ions do not coordinate copper(II) but lead to a shift in the distribution of copper chloro-complexes toward more coordinated species. Electrochemically, the increased availability of chloride anions in solution stabilized the Cu(II)-rich solution and led to increased reversibility of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox process. Full article"

Effects of State-of-Charge and Penetration Location on Variations in Temperature and Terminal Voltage of a Lithium-Ion Battery Cell during Penetration Tests,"Yiqun Liu, Yitian Li, Y.

In this paper, the effects of cell initial State-of-Charge (SOC) and penetration location on variations in cell temperature and terminal voltage during penetration tests are investigated. Three different initial SOCs (10%, 50%, and 90%) and three different penetration locations (one is at the center of the cell, the other two are close to the edge of the cell) are used in the tests. Once the steel cone starts to penetrate the cell, the cell terminal voltage starts to drop due to the internal short-circuit. The penetration tests with higher initial cell SOCs have larger cell surface temperature increases during the tests. Also, the penetration location always has the highest temperature increment during all penetration tests, which means the heat source is always at the penetration location. The absolute temperature increment at the penetration location is always higher when the penetration is close to the edge of the cell, compared to when the penetration is at the center of the cell. The heat generated at the edges of the cell is more difficult to dissipate. Additionally, a battery cell internal short-circuit model with different penetration locations is built in ANSYS Fluent, based on the specifications and experimental data of the tested battery cells. The model is validated with an acceptable discrepancy range by using the experimental data. Simulated data shows that the temperature gradually reduces from penetration locations to their surroundings. The gradients of the temperature distributions are much larger closer to the penetration locations. Overall, this paper provides detailed information on the temperature and terminal voltage variations of a lithium-ion polymer battery cell with large capacity and high power under penetration tests. The presented information can be used for assessing the safety of the onboard battery pack of electric vehicles. Full article"

The Li-ion battery is currently the most common battery used in EVs due to its high energy density, durability, safety, and cost competitiveness. Nickel is predicted to be an essential component for the lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NMC) as a cathode material of choice for EV applications. Indonesia, one of the world’s largest nickel ore suppliers, put an export ban on nickel ore effective from 2020. The bold movement was intended to initiate the domestic EV industry and encourage investors abroad to drive their manufacturing activities into the country. On the other hand, the global Li-ion battery manufacturers who imported nickel from Indonesia had to restrategize their businesses. This review discussed the chronological events leading to the ban and after the ban from the media, government regulations, and literature reviews. The authors of this study also conducted interviews and attended seminars with the national experts and key players in the battery and EV industry to gain their most pertinent insights. The SWOT analysis of the reviewed materials indicated that while the Indonesian battery industry is still new, it needs to diversify its research and development activities and collaborate internationally to optimize the utilization of its resources and meet the purchasing power of the domestic EV market. Finally, this study summarized six key factors to support Indonesia’s ambition to be a new regional hub for EVs. These factors are: (1) pricing, (2) technology, (3) policy, (4) investment, (5) infrastructure, and (6) compliance with sustainability standards. Full article"

Studying their behaviour under mechanical loading, including short circuits, is vital for vehicle safety. This paper covers three major topics, (1) a general literature review for the state-of-the-art of LIBs, (2) physical cell tests for model validation are performed, wherein the occurrence of short circuits is detected and (3) creating a finite element model (FEM) of an 18650 cylindrical LIB using the most recent testing and simulation techniques. A variety of short-circuit criteria based on stresses, strains and geometric parameters have been implemented in the simulation and compared to the test results. It will be demonstrated that a combination of two geometric criteria, in the radial and axial directions of the cell, is best suited for virtual short-circuit detection in the simulation. Finally, the short-circuit criteria are implemented in a post-processing tool that allows fast short-circuit analysis of cells of different loadings. In the future, this method of short-circuit detection will be used to analyse an assembly of several battery cells such as, for instance, an automotive or maritime battery pack.

While the perceived benefits strongly encourage the use of DT, in the battery industry a consistent implementation approach and quantitative assessment of adapting a battery DT is missing. This paper is a part of an ongoing study that investigates the DT functionalities and quantifies the DT-attributes across the life cycles phases of a battery system. The critical question is whether battery DT is a practical and realistic solution to meeting the growing challenges of the battery industry, such as degradation evaluation, usage optimization, manufacturing inconsistencies or second-life application possibility. Within the scope of this paper, a consistent approach of DT implementation for battery cells is presented, and the main functions of the approach are tested on a Doyle-Fuller-Newman model. In essence, a battery DT can offer improved representation, performance estimation, and behavioral predictions based on real-world data along with the integration of battery life cycle attributes. Hence, this paper identifies the efforts for implementing a battery DT and provides the quantification attribute for future academic or industrial research. Full article"

ASSBs based on sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted much attention because of their high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical windows of the sulfide SEs. Here, we study the electrochemical performance of ASSBs using composite electrodes prepared via two processes (simple mixture and solution processes) and varying the ionic conductor additive (80Li 2 S∙20P 2 S 5 and argyrodite-type Li 6 PS 5 Cl). The composite electrodes consist of lithium-silicate-coated LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 (NMC), a sulfide SE, and carbon additives. The charge-transfer resistance at the interface of the solid electrolyte and NMC is the main parameter related to the ASSB’s status. This value decreases when the composite electrodes are prepared via a solution process. The lithium silicate coating and the use of a high-Li-ion additive conductor are also important to reduce the interfacial resistance and achieve high initial capacities (140 mAh g −1 ). Full article"

However, recent studies focus primarily on composite or hybrid electrolytes that mix LLTO with organic polymeric materials. There are scarce studies of pure (100%) LLTO electrolytes in solid-state LMBs and there is a need to shed more light on this type of electrolyte and its potential for LMBs. Therefore, in our review, we first elaborated on the structure/property relationship between compositions of perovskites and their ionic conductivities. We then summarized current issues and some successful attempts for the fabrication of pure LLTO electrolytes. Their electrochemical and battery performances were also presented. We focused on tape casting as an effective method to prepare pure LLTO thin films that are compatible and can be easily integrated into existing roll-to-roll battery manufacturing processes. This review intends to shed some light on the design and manufacturing of LLTO for all-ceramic electrolytes towards safer and higher power density solid-state LMBs. Full article"

In this context, the circular use of electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) is particularly relevant because of the resource intensity during manufacturing. After reaching the end-of-life phase, EVBs can be subjected to various circular economy strategies, all of which require the previous disassembly. Today, disassembly is carried out manually and represents a bottleneck process. At the same time, extremely high return volumes have been forecast for the next few years, and manual disassembly is associated with safety risks. That is why automated disassembly is identified as being a key enabler of highly efficient circularity. However, several challenges need to be addressed to ensure secure, economic, and ecological disassembly processes. One of these is ensuring that optimal disassembly strategies are determined, considering the uncertainties during disassembly. This paper introduces our design for an adaptive disassembly planner with an integrated disassembly strategy optimizer. Furthermore, we present our optimization method for obtaining optimal disassembly strategies as a combination of three decisions: (1) the optimal disassembly sequence, (2) the optimal disassembly depth, and (3) the optimal circular economy strategy at the component level. Finally, we apply the proposed method to derive optimal disassembly strategies for one selected battery system for two condition scenarios. The results show that the optimization of disassembly strategies must also be used as a tool in the design phase of battery systems to boost the disassembly automation and thus contribute to achieving profitable circular economy solutions for EVBs.

This study uses molecular simulation and computational chemistry tools to investigate the initial nucleation and growth dynamics of LiOH and Li 2 O that provide us with thermodynamics and structural information about the nucleating clusters of each species. Following the most favorable pathways for the addition of each of the components to a given nascent SEI cluster reveals their preferential nucleation mechanisms and illustrates different degrees of crystallinity and electron density distribution that are useful to understand ionic transport through SEI blocks.

Among them, the LUMO energy of the reactant compounds, regardless of the level of theory used for its calculation, showed the best performance as a descriptor for the prediction of experimental redox potentials. This finding contrasts with our earlier results on the calculation of quinone redox potentials in aqueous media for redox flow batteries, for which the redox reaction energy was the best descriptor. Furthermore, the combination of geometry optimization using low-level methods (e.g., SEQM or DFTB) followed by energy calculation with DFT yielded accuracy as good as the full optimization of geometry using the DFT calculations. Thus, the proposed calculation scheme is useful for both the optimum use of computational resources and the systematic generation of robust calculation data on quinone-based cathode compounds for the training of data-driven material discovery models.

Comprehensive Insights into the Porosity of Lithium-Ion Battery Electrodes: A Comparative Study on Positive Electrodes Based on LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2(NMC622),"Thomas Beuse, Mathias Fingerle, Christian Wagner, Martin Winter, Markus Börner",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7040070,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/4/70/pdf?version=1635310825,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/4/70,55,"Porosity is frequently specified as only a value to describe the microstructure of a battery electrode. However, porosity is a key parameter for the battery electrode performance and mechanical properties such as adhesion and structural electrode integrity during charge/discharge cycling. This study illustrates the importance of using more than one method to describe the electrode microstructure of LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 (NMC622)-based positive electrodes. A correlative approach, from simple thickness measurements to tomography and segmentation, allowed deciphering the true porous electrode structure and to comprehend the advantages and inaccuracies of each of the analytical techniques. Herein, positive electrodes were calendered from a porosity of 44–18% to cover a wide range of electrode microstructures in state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. Especially highly densified electrodes cannot simply be described by a close packing of active and inactive material components, since a considerable amount of active material particles crack due to the intense calendering process. Therefore, a digital 3D model was created based on tomography data and simulation of the inactive material, which allowed the investigation of the complete pore network. For lithium-ion batteries, the results of the mercury intrusion experiments in combination with gas physisorption/pycnometry experiments provide comprehensive insight into the microstructure of positive electrodes.

In the present study, a carbon coating was applied onto nickel-rich NMC622 via polymerisation of furfuryl alcohol, followed by calcination, for the first time. The formation of a uniform amorphous carbon layer was observed with scanning- and transmission-electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The stability of the coated active material was confirmed and the electrochemical behaviour as well as the cycling stability was evaluated. The impact of the heat treatment on the electrochemical performance was studied systematically and was shown to improve cycling and high current performance alike. In-depth investigations of polymer coated samples show that the improved performance can be correlated with the calcination temperatures. In particular, a heat treatment at 400 °C leads to enhanced reversibility and capacity retention even after 400 cycles. At 10C, the discharge capacity for carbon coated NMC increases by nearly 50% compared to uncoated samples. This study clearly shows for the first time the synergetic effects of a furfuryl polymer coating and subsequent calcination leading to improved electrochemical performance of nickel-rich NMC622.

It is believed that this kinetic equation can describe any reaction. The choice of parameters is often made without justifications. We assumed it necessary to develop a method to select the parameters. The method proposed is based on data coming from an accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) test. The method has been applied on data obtained for cells aged on different conditions. Thanks to a post-mortem analysis and simulations carried out using the parameters obtained, we have shown that the ageing mechanisms have a major impact on the parameters. Full article"
Influence of Temperature and Electrolyte Composition on the Performance of Lithium Metal Anodes,"Sanaz Momeni Boroujeni, Alexander Fill, Alexander Ridder, Kai Peter Birke",2021,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries7040067,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/4/67/pdf?version=1634270743,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/7/4/67,7,"Lithium metal anodes have again attracted widespread attention due to the continuously growing demand of cells with higher energy density. However, the lithium deposition mechanism and the affecting process of influencing factors, such as temperature, cycling current density, and electrolyte composition are not fully understood and require further investigation. In this article, the behavior of lithium metal anode at different temperatures (25, 40, and 60 ∘ ∘ C), lithium salts, electrolyte concentrations (1 and 2 M), and the applied cell current (equivalent to 0.5 C, 1 C, and 2 C). is investigated. Two different salts were evaluated: lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesul-fonyl)imide (LiTFSI). The cells at a medium temperature (40 ∘ ∘ C) show the highest Coulombic efficiency (CE). However, shorter cycle life is observed compared to the experiments at room temperature (25 ∘ ∘ C). Regardless of electrolyte type and C-rate, the higher temperature of 60 ∘ ∘ C provides the worst Coulombic efficiency and cycle life among those at the examined temperatures. A higher C-rate has a positive effect on the stability over the cycle life of the lithium cells. The best performance in terms of long cycle life and relatively good Coulombic efficiency is achieved by fast charging the cell with high concentration LiFSI in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte at a temperature of 25 ∘ ∘ C. The cell has an average Coulombic efficiency of 0.987 over 223 cycles. In addition to galvanostatic experiments, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to study the evolution of the interface under different conditions during cycling.

The solution to this problem can be found in development of 3D batteries. The present work deals with the development of a technology for a 3D solid-state lithium-ion battery (3D SSLIB) manufacturing by plasma-chemical etching and magnetron sputtering technique. The results on testing of experimental samples of 3D SSLIB are presented. It was found that submicron-scale steps appearing on the surface of a 3D structure formed on Si substrate by the Bosch process radically change the crystal structure of the upper functional layers. Such changes can lead to disruption of the layers’ continuity, especially that of the down conductors. It is shown that surface polishing by liquid etching of the SiO 2 layer and silicon reoxidation leads to surface smoothing, the replacement of the dendrite structure of functional layers by a block structure, and a significant improvement in the capacitive characteristics of the battery.

The detection of defects and poor insulation behavior of the separator is essential for high-quality batteries. Optical quality control methods in cell production are unable to detect small but still relevant defects in the separator layer, e.g., pinholes or particle contaminations. This gap can be closed by executing high-potential testing to analyze the insulation performance of the electrically insulating separator layer in a pouch cell. Here, we present an experimental study to identify different separator defects on dry cell stacks on the basis of electric voltage stress and mechanical pressure. In addition, finite element modeling (FEM) is used to generate physical insights into the partial discharge by examining the defect structures and the corresponding electric fields, including topographical electrode roughness, impurity particles, and voids in the separator. The test results show that hard discharges are associated with significant separator defects. Based on the study, a voltage of 350 to 450 V and a pressure of 0.3 to 0.6 N/mm 2 are identified as optimum ranges for the test methodology, resulting in failure detection rates of up to 85%.

In this study, a novel tetrabutylammonium (TBA) alginate binder is used to prepare a Na 0.67 MnO 2 electrode for sodium-ion batteries with improved electrochemical performance. The ageing of the electrodes is characterized. TBA alginate-based electrodes are compared to polyvinylidene fluoride- (PVDF) and Na alginate-based electrodes and show favorable electrochemical performance, with gravimetric capacity values of up to 164 mAh/g, which is 6% higher than measured for the electrode prepared with PVDF binder. TBA alginate-based electrodes also display good rate capability and improved cyclability. The solid–electrolyte interface of TBA alginate-based electrodes is similar to that of PVDF-based electrodes. As the only salt of alginic acid soluble in non-aqueous solvents, TBA alginate emerges as a good alternative to PVDF binder in battery applications where the water-based processing of electrode slurries is not feasible, such as the demonstrated case with Na 0.67 MnO 2 .

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the addition of fluoride is successfully doped to the spinel-type structure of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 without any impurities being detected. The carbon and nitrogen coating are distributed on the surface of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 particles, as shown in the Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) image. The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) image shows a thin layer of carbon coating on the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 surface. The fluoride-doped Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 has the highest specific discharge capacity of 165.38 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C and capacity fading of 93.51% after 150 cycles compared to other samples, indicating improved electrochemical performance. This is attributed to the synergy between the appropriate amount of carbon and nitrogen coating, which induced a high mobility of electrons and larger crystallite size due to the insertion of fluoride to the spinel-type structure of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , enhancing lithium-ion transfer during the insertion/extraction process.

This study aims to obtain the LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 (NMC) cathode material using a simple flash coprecipitation method. As precipitation agents and pH regulators, oxalic acid and ammonia are widely available and inexpensive. The composition of the NMC mole ratio was varied, with values of 333, 424, 442, 523, 532, 622, and 811. As a comprehensive study of NMC, lithium transition-metal oxide (LMO, LCO, and LNO) is also provided. The crystal structure, functional groups, morphology, elemental composition and material behavior of the particles were all investigated during the heating process. The galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis was tested with cylindrical cells and using mesocarbon microbeads/graphite as the anode. Cells were tested at 2.7–4.25 V at 0.5 C.

The key challenges facing ASSBs are low conductivity and slow charge transfer kinetics at the interface between the electrode and the solid electrolyte. Garnet solid-state electrolyte has shown promising results in improving the ion conductivity but still suffers from poor capacity retention and rate performance due to the interfacial resistance between the electrodes. To improve the interfacial resistance, we prepared a composite consisting of Li 7 La 2.75 Ca 0.25 Zr 1.75 Nb 0.25 O 12 (LLCZN) garnet material as the ceramic, polyethylene oxide (PEO) as the polymer, and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6 ) as the salt. These compounds are mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and developed into a very thin disc-shaped solid electrolyte. The LLCZN provides a lithium-ion transport path to enhance the lithium-ion conduction during charging and discharging cycles, while the LiPF 6 contributes more lithium ions via the transport path. The PEO matrix in the composite material aids in bonding the compounds together and creating a large contact area, thereby reducing the issue of large interfacial resistance. FESEM images show the porous nature of the electrolyte which promotes the movement of lithium ions through the electrolyte. The fabricated LLCZN/PEO/LiPF 6 solid-state electrolyte shows outstanding electrochemical stability that remains at 130 mAh g −1 up to 150 charging and discharging cycles at 0.05 mA cm −2 current. All the specific capacities were calculated based on the mass of the cathode material (LiCoO 2 ). In addition, the coin cell retains 85% discharge capacity up to 150 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98% and energy efficiency of 90% during the entire cycling process.

The calculated diffusion coefficient of Na + , K + , and Mg 2+ are in the same order of magnitude, which indicates that the three-dimensional ionic channels and interstices in the lattice of TiHCF are large enough for an efficient Na + , K + and Mg 2+ insertion and extraction.

As a result, activation energy for the overall reaction of the TR was estimated to be 39.9 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the safety guarantee time mandated by the safety regulation for vehicle batteries is 5 min; an analysis of the experiment results reveals that the following conditions can be satisfied: [Math Processing Error] T P = 308.4 °C, [Math Processing Error] Δ t t 1 − t 0 = 5 min; [Math Processing Error] T P = 326.2 °C, [Math Processing Error] Δ t t 2 − t 0 = 5 min.

Using the BTT-GDY lattice and by replacing the S atoms with N, NH and O, we designed three novel GDY lattices, which we named BTHP-, BTP- and BTF-GDY, respectively. Next, we explored structural, electronic, mechanical, optical, photocatalytic and Li-ion storage properties, as well as carrier mobilities, of novel GDY monolayers. Phonon dispersion relations, mechanical and failure behavior were explored using the machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The obtained HSE06 results reveal that BTX-GDYs (X = P, F, T) are direct gap semiconductors with band gaps in the range of 2.49–2.65 eV, whereas the BTHP-GDY shows a narrow indirect band gap of 0.06 eV. With appropriate band offsets, good carrier mobilities and a strong capability for the absorption of visible and ultraviolet range of light, BTF- and BTT-GDYs were predicted to be promising candidates for overall photocatalytic water splitting. The BTHP-GDY nanosheet, noticeably, was found to yield an ultrahigh Li-ion storage capacity of over 2400 mAh/g.

In this paper, a detailed method is presented to make long-term predictions for the RUL based on a combination of gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU NN) and soft-sensing method. Firstly, an indirect health indicator (HI) was extracted from the charging processes using a soft-sensing method that can accurately describe power degradation instead of capacity. Then, a GRU NN with a sliding window was applied to learn the long-term performance development. The method also uses a dropout and early stopping method to prevent overfitting.

Polyaniline—Graphene Electrodes Prepared by Electropolymerization for High-Performance Capacitive Electrodes: A Brief Review,"Olena Okhay, Alexander Tkach",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8100191,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/191/pdf?version=1666616020,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/191,7,"Both polyaniline (PANI) and graphene are widely studied for their application as capacitive electrodes in energy storage devices. However, although PANI can be easy synthesized, is of low cost and has a higher specific capacitance than graphene, pristine PANI electrodes do not present long-term stability due to their large volume changes during release/doping of the electrolyte ions and surface area reduction with charge-discharge cycling. That is why a combination of PANI with carbonaceous materials, especially conductive and high-surface-area graphene as well as more widely used reduced graphene oxide (rGO), provides an effective approach to solve these problems. At the same time, the electropolymerization process is one of the possible methods for synthesis of PANI composites with G or rGO as freestanding electrodes. Therefore, no binders or additives such as carbon black or active carbon need to be used to obtain PANI/rGO electrodes by electrochemical polymerization (EP), in contrast to similar electrodes prepared by the chemical oxidative polymerization method. Thus, in this paper, we review recent advances in EP synthesis of PANI/rGO nanocomposites as high-performance capacitive electrode materials, combining the advantages of both electrical double-layer capacitance of rGO and pseudocapacitance of PANI, which hence exhibit long cycle life and high specific energy.

New approaches for lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling have to be investigated and new technologies developed in order to secure the future supply of battery metals (i.e., lithium, cobalt, nickel). In this work, the possibility of integrating LIB recycling with secondary copper smelting was further investigated. The time-dependent behavior of battery metals (Li, Co, Ni, Mn) in simulated secondary copper smelting conditions was investigated for the first time. In the study, copper alloy was used as a medium for collecting valuable metals and the distribution coefficients of these metals between copper alloy and slag were used for evaluating the recycling efficiencies. The determined distribution coefficients follow the order Ni >> Co >> Mn > Li throughout the time range investigated. In our study, the evolution of phases and their chemical composition were investigated in laboratory-scale experiments under reducing conditions of oxygen partial pressure p(O 2 ) = 10 −10 atm, at 1300 °C. The results showed that already after 1 h holding time, the major elements were in equilibrium. However, based on the microstructural observations and trace elements distributions, the required full equilibration time for the system was determined to be 16 h. Full article"

Consequently, state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and remaining useful life (RUL) for SMS must be developed to evaluate supercapacitor robustness and reliability for mitigating supercapacitor issues related to safety and economic loss. State estimation of SMS results in safe operation and eliminates undesirable event occurrences and malfunctions. However, state estimations of SMS are challenging and tedious, as SMS is subject to various internal and external factors such as internal degradation mechanism and environmental factors. This review presents a comprehensive discussion and analysis of model-based and data-driven-based techniques for SOC, SOH, and RUL estimations of SMS concerning outcomes, advantages, disadvantages, and research gaps. The work also investigates various key implementation factors such as a supercapacitor test bench platform, experiments, a supercapacitor cell, data pre-processing, data size, model operation, functions, hyperparameter adjustments, and computational capability. Several key limitations, challenges, and issues regarding SOC, SOH, and RUL estimations are outlined. Lastly, effective suggestions are outlined for future research improvements towards delivering accurate and effective SOC, SOH, and RUL estimations of SMS. Critical analysis and discussion would be useful for developing accurate SMS technology for state estimation of a supercapacitor with clean energy and high reliability, and will provide significant contributions towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) to achieve global collaboration and sustainable development goals (SDGs).

This paper details a multi-year cycling study of commercial 24 Ah pouch batteries with Li(NiMnCo)O 2 (NCM) cathode, varying the average state of charge (SOC), depth of discharge (DOD), and charging rate by 33 groups of experiment matrix. Based on the reduced freedom voltage parameter reconstruction (RF-VPR), a more efficient non-intrusive diagnosis is combined with incremental capacity (IC) analysis to evaluate the aging mechanisms including loss of lithium-ion inventory and loss of active material on the cathode and anode. By analyzing the evolution of indicator parameters and the cumulative degradation function (CDF) of the battery capacity, a non-linear degradation model with calendar and cyclic aging is established to evaluate the battery aging cost under different unmanaged charging (V0G) and V2G scenarios. The result shows that, although the extra energy throughput would cause cyclic degradation, discharging from SOC 90 to 65% by V2G will surprisingly alleviate the battery decaying by 0.95% compared to the EV charged within 90–100% SOC, due to the improvement of calendar life. By optimal charging strategies, the connection to the smart grid can potentially extend the EV battery life beyond the scenarios without V2G. Full article"

However, standalone battery-based energy storage systems are inefficient in terms of the shelf and cycle life, reliability, and overall performance, especially in instantaneous variations in solar irradiance and load. In order to overcome this, a combination of a supercapacitor and battery-based hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is considered as an emerging and viable solution. The present work proposes an optimally tuned tilt-integral (TI) controller to develop an efficient power management strategy (PMS) to enhance the overall system performance. The controller parameters are tuned by optimization of the time-domain design specifications using a gradient-free simplex search technique. The robustness of the proposed TI controller is demonstrated in comparison to PI and fractional-order PI (FOPI) controllers. Furthermore, extensive experimentation was carried out to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach for DC bus voltage stabilization and state-of-charge (SOC) management under varying operating conditions such as solar irradiance, load, temperature, and SOC consumption by battery.

The characteristics of the positive electrode (cathode active material, CAM) significantly contribute to the battery’s functional properties. Applying various functional coatings is one of the productive ways to improve the work characteristics of lithium-ion batteries. Nowadays, there are many methods for depositing thin films on a material’s surface; among them, one of the most promising is atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD allows for the formation of thin and uniform coatings on surfaces with complex geometric forms, including porous structures. This review is devoted to applying the ALD method in obtaining thin functional coatings for cathode materials and includes an overview of more than 100 publications. The most thoroughly investigated surface modifications are lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium manganese spinel (LMO), lithium nickel-cobalt-manganese oxides (NCM), lithium-nickel-manganese spinel (LNMO), and lithium-manganese rich (LMR) cathode materials. The most studied processes of deposition are aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ), titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) and zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2 ) films. The primary purposes of such studies are to find the synthesis parameters of films, to find the optimal coating thickness (e.g., ~1–2 nm for Al 2 O 3 , ~1 nm for ZrO 2 , <1 nm for TiO 2 , etc.), and to reveal the effect of the coating on the electrochemical parameters of batteries. The review summarizes synthesis conditions, investigation results of deposited films on CAMs and positive electrodes and some functional effects observed due to films obtained by ALD on cathodes.

However, their disposable nature represents a relevant environmental issue. In this work, we propose the utilization of two types of disposed (waste) face masks to prepare hard carbons (biochar) by pyrolytic conversion in mild conditions. Moreover, we evaluated the application of the produced hard carbons as anode materials in Na-ion batteries. Pristine face masks were firstly analyzed through infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The pyrolysis of both mask types resulted in highly disordered carbons, as revealed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, with a very low specific surface area. Anodes prepared with these carbons were tested in laboratory-scale Na-metal cells through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling, displaying an acceptable specific capacity along a wide range of current regimes, with a good coulombic efficiency (>98% over at least 750 cycles). As a proof of concept, the anodes were also used to assemble a Na-ion cell in combination with a Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3 (NVPF) cathode and tested towards galvanostatic cycling, with an initial capacity of almost 120 mAhg −1 (decreasing at about 47 mAhg −1 after 50 cycles). Even though further optimization is required for a real application, the achieved electrochemical performances represent a preliminary confirmation of the possibility of repurposing disposable face masks into higher-value materials for Na-ion batteries.

X-ray diffraction exhibited the single phase of nanostructured binary and ternary TiFe-based crystallites after 20 h of milling followed the amorphous phase formation. Addition of Mn increased peak broadening and in turn decreased the nanocrystallite size of TiFe. Electrode properties of 20, 40, 60, and 70 h binary milled products showed that the discharge capacity of the 60 h one offered a maximum discharge capacity of ~169 mAhg −1 .

The best way to solve this problem is by preheating power battery packs. Power battery packs have relatively high requirements with regard to the uniformity of temperature distribution during the preheating process. Aimed at this problem, taking a 30 Ah LiFePO4 (LFP) pouch battery as the research object, a three-sided liquid cooling structure that takes into account the preheating of the battery module was designed. On the basis of analyzing the influence of the cooling plate arrangement, cooling liquid flow rate, liquid medium, and inlet temperature on the temperature consistency of the battery module, the orthogonal simulation method was used to formulate the optimal combination of factors for different cooling objectives. Using the designed preheating structure, a combined internal and external preheating strategy based on the available battery power is proposed. The research results show that the cooling plate arrangement scheme and the inlet temperature have obvious influences on the preheating effect, while the increase in the flow velocity of the preheating effect is saturated. The optimized external preheating structure can maintain the preheating temperature difference of the battery module at less than 5 °C. On this basis, the proposed combined internal and external preheating strategy saves 50% of the preheating time compared with three-sided preheating. Full article"
Hybrid Equalization Topology for Battery Management Systems Applied to an Electric Vehicle Model,"José Rodolfo Galvão, Lucas Braggião Calligaris, Kawe Monteiro de Souza, Joelton Deonei Gotz, Paulo Broniera Junior, Fernanda Cristina Corrêa",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8100178,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/178/pdf?version=1665567691,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/178,20,"This paper presents a hybrid equalization (EQ) topology of lithium-ion batteries (LIB). Currently, LIBs are widely used for electric mobility due to their characteristics of high energy density and multiple recharge cycles. In an electric vehicle (EV), these batteries are connected in series and/or parallel until the engine reaches the voltage and energy capacity required. For LIBs to operate safely, a battery management system (BMS) is required. This system monitors and controls voltage, current, and temperature parameters. Among the various functions of a BMS, voltage equalization is of paramount importance for the safety and useful life of LIBs. There are two main voltage equalization techniques: passive and active. Passive equalization dissipates energy, and active equalization transfers energy between the LIBs. The passive has the advantage of being simple to implement; however, it has a longer equalization time and energy loss. Active is complex to implement but has fast equalization time and lower energy loss. This paper proposes the combination of these two techniques to implement simultaneously to control a pack of LIBs, equalizing voltage between stacks and at the cell level. For this purpose, a pack of LIBs was simulated with sixty-four cells connected in series and divided into eight stacks with eight battery cells each. The rated voltage of each cell is 3.7 V, with a capacity of 106 Ah. The total pack has a voltage of 236.8 V and 25 kW. Some LIBs were fitted with different SOC values to simulate an imbalance between cells. In the simulations, different topologies were evaluated: passive and active topology at the cell level and combined active and passive equalization at the pack level. Results are compared as a response time and state of charge (SOC) level. In addition, equalization topologies are applied in an EV model with the FTP75 conduction cycle. In this way, it is possible to evaluate the autonomy of each equalization technique simulated in this work. The hybrid topology active at the stack level and passive at the module level showed promising results in equalization time and autonomy compared with a purely active or passive equalization technique. This combination is a solution to achieve low EQ time and satisfactory SOC when compared to a strictly active or passive EQ. Full article"

Especially when operating a battery with high loads in dense battery systems, a cooling system is required to keep the cell in a controlled temperature range. Therefore, an existing battery module is set up with a water-based liquid cooling system with aluminum cooling plates. A finite-element simulation is used to optimize the design and arrangement of the cooling plates regarding power consumption, cooling efficiency, and temperature homogeneity. The heat generation of an operating Li-ion battery is described by the lumped battery model, which is integrated into COMSOL Multiphysics. As the results show, a small set of non-destructively determined parameters of the lumped battery model is sufficient to estimate heat generation. The simulated temperature distribution within the battery pack confirmed adequate cooling and good temperature homogeneity as measured by an integrated temperature sensor array. Furthermore, the simulation reveals sufficient cooling of the batteries by using only one cooling plate per two pouch cells while continuously discharging at up to 3 C. Full article"
Crest Factor Optimization for Multisine Excitation Signals with Logarithmic Frequency Distribution Based on a Hybrid Stochastic-Deterministic Optimization Algorithm,"Ahmed Yahia Kallel, Olfa Kanoun",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8100176,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/176/pdf?version=1665551392,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/176,9,"For diagnosis of batteries and fuel cells based on impedance spectroscopy, excitation signals are required, including low frequencies down to the mHz range. This leads to a long measurement time and compromises the stability condition for impedance spectroscopy. Multisine excitation signals with logarithmic frequency distribution can significantly reduce the measurement time but need optimization of the crest factor to realize a high signal-to-noise ratio at all excitation frequencies and maintain at the same time the linearity and stability conditions of impedance spectroscopy. Crest factor optimization is challenging, as the obtained results strongly depend on the initial phase values and many trials are necessary. It takes a very long time and can not be easily performed automatically up to now. In this paper, we propose a time-efficient hybrid stochastic-deterministic crest factor optimization method for multisine signals with logarithmic frequency distribution. A sigmoid transform on the multisine signal gradually transforms the multi-frequency signal into a binary-alike signal. The crest factor is significantly decreased, but the phases of the singular frequency signals remain sub-optimal. Further optimization based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm can determine the final phases, realizing a lower crest factor. The proposed method is less sensitive to initial phase values and provides more reasonable results in a reasonable time. The validation on a Samsung INR-18650-25R Lithium-ion battery cell shows that the crest factor of the optimized multisine signals has a median of 3.62 ± 0.7 within 6 min of run time, which is significantly better than the best previous work in the state-of-the-art of 3.85 ± 0.11 for the same run time.

One key step in the production sequence is the process of cell-internal contacting, during which the electrode carrier foils of the anode and the cathode are joined with the arrester. This is usually done with ultrasonic or laser beam welding. Both joining processes, however, show limitations concerning the quality of the weld. This paper presents a new approach for cell-internal contacting by using micro-friction stir spot welding. Welding experiments were conducted in which joints with high mechanical strengths were produced. It was also shown that large stacks with foil numbers of 100 can be joined in only a few tenths of a second. The process is therefore especially of interest for the fast production of large-scale battery cells or other new types of high-energy-dense battery cells. Full article"

However, the mechanical strength apparently decreased once the percentage of LITFSI was over 60%. The hybrid electrolyte with 60% LiTFSI content showed high ionic conductivity of 2.14 × 10 −4 S cm −1 , a wide electrochemical stability window (3–6 V) and good electrochemical stability. The capacity of the Li|60% LiTFSI/PVDF-HFP/LATP| LiFePO 4 solid-state lithium-metal battery was 103.8 mA h g −1 at 0.1 C, with a high-capacity retention of 98% after 50 cycles. Full article"

However, its poor cycling stability limits its application as an electrode material. In this study, a series of Zn-doped VO 2 (V 1− x Zn x O 2 ) nanorods were successfully fabricated by the technology of one-step hydrothermal synthesis. The XRD result indicated that there was a slight lattice distortion caused by doped Zn 2+ with a larger ion radius. The positron lifetime spectrum showed that there were vacancy cluster defects in all the samples. The electrochemical measurement demonstrated the enhancement of the specific capacitance of V 1− x Zn x O 2 electrodes compared with the undoped sample. In addition, the discharge capacitance of the sample remained around 86% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This work proves that Zn 2+ doping is a valid tactic for the application of nano-VO 2 (B) in energy storage electrode materials. Full article"

Various types of protective systems have been proposed to prevent thermal runaway and subsequent battery combustion. Among them, thermoresistive systems, representing polymer composites that sharply increase their resistance when the temperature rises, have been actively investigated. However, they are triggered only when the heating of the battery has already occurred, i.e., the system undergoes irreversible changes. This paper describes a new type of protective polymer layer based on the intrinsically conducting polymer poly[Ni(CH 3 OSalen)]. The response mechanism of this layer is based on an increase in resistance both when heated and when the cell voltage exceeds the permissible range. This makes it possible to stop undesirable processes at an earlier stage. The properties of the polymer itself and of the lithium-ion batteries modified by the protective layer have been studied. It is shown that the introduction of the polymer protective layer into the battery design leads to a rapid increase of the internal resistance at short circuit, which reduces the discharge current and sharply reduces the heat release. The effectiveness of the protection is confirmed by analysis of the battery components before the short circuit and after it. Full article"
Study of SOC Estimation by the Ampere-Hour Integral Method with Capacity Correction Based on LSTM,"Xin Zhang, Jiawei Hou, Zekun Wang, Yueqiu Jiang",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8100170,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/170/pdf?version=1665306645,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/170,71,"The estimation of the state of charge (SOC) of a battery’s power is one of the key technologies in a battery management system (BMS). As a common SOC estimation method, the traditional ampere-hour integral method regards the actual capacity of the battery, which is constantly changed by the usage conditions and environment, as a constant for calculation, which may cause errors in the results of SOC estimation. Considering the above problems, this paper proposes an improved ampere-hour integral method based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model. The LSTM network model is used to obtain the actual battery capacity variation, replacing the fixed value of battery capacity in the traditional ampere-hour integral method and optimizing the traditional ampere-hour integral method to improve the accuracy of the SOC estimation method. The experimental results show that the errors of the results obtained by the improved ampere-hour integral method for the SOC estimation are all less than 10%, which proves that the proposed design method is feasible and effective.

In spite of nearly meeting the target in terms of energy density and cost, enhanced safety, lifetime, and second-life applications, there remain challenges. As a result of the difference between the electric characteristics of the cells, the degradation process is accelerated for battery packs containing many cells. The development of new generation battery solutions for transportation and grid storage with improved performance is the goal of this paper, which introduces the novel concept of Smart Battery that brings together batteries with advanced power electronics and artificial intelligence (AI). The key feature is a bypass device attached to each cell that can insert relaxation time to individual cell operation with minimal effect on the load. An advanced AI-based performance optimizer is trained to recognize early signs of accelerated degradation modes and to decide upon the optimal insertion of relaxation time. The resulting pulsed current operation has been proven to extend lifetime by up to 80% in laboratory aging conditions. The Smart Battery unique architecture uses a digital twin to accelerate the training of performance optimizers and predict failures. The Smart Battery technology is a new technology currently at the proof-of-concept stage. Full article"

The structural and morphological properties of various Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 materials and their correlation with electrochemical performance were analysed. The results showed that there was a strong correlation between high capacity retention at 10 C and the specific surface area. Other electrochemical and structural factors, such as the crystal size and pore structure, were not correlated with 10 C performance. We found that an increase in the specific surface area of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 above c.a. 15 m 2 g −1 neither improved the high rate capacity retention nor its specific discharge capacity at high current rates. We also showed that the sol–gel synthesized lithium titanium oxide powders could retain similar or higher discharge specific capacities than materials synthesized via more complex routes.

Impact of On-Board Hybrid Energy Storage Devices on Energy-Saving Operation for Electric Trains in DC Railway Systems,"Bolun Zhang, Shaofeng Lu, Yang Peng, Chaoxian Wu, Guangzhao Meng, Minling Feng, Bingjian Liu",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8100167,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/167/pdf?version=1666584168,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/167,20,"To improve the energy-efficiency of transport systems, it is necessary to investigate electric trains with on-board hybrid energy storage devices (HESDs), which are applied to assist the traction and recover the regenerative energy. In this paper, a time-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to obtain the energy-saving operation for electric trains with different constraints of on-board HESDs, such as their capacity, initial state of charge (SOC), and level of degradation. The proposed integrated power flow model based on the train longitudinal dynamics, power split of on-board HESDs, and line impedance is discretized and linearized, aiming to minimize the net energy consumption (NEC). The results reveal that on-board HESDs with a higher capacity does not necessarily lead to a higher energy-saving rate; a lower or excessive initial SOC could undermine the energy-saving potential; considering the long-term train operation, the degradation of the Li-ion battery will influence the energy-saving operation for electric trains, as well as result in an energy-saving rate that ranges from 41.57% to 31.90%. The practical data from Guangzhou Metro Line 7 were applied in the simulations, which enhanced the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. Full article"

This work reports, for the first time, an evaluation of carbon papers, felt and cloth in a three-electrode half-cell setup as potential bromine electrodes, in pristine and thermally treated state. A systematic evaluation was performed by comparing the surface morphologies, kinetic parameters, polarisation curves and stability tests of different carbon electrodes. Thermally treated graphite felt electrode demonstrated the best electrochemical performance as bromine electrode owing to its improved surface area, hydrophilicity and intrinsic activity. Further in-depth studies will shed important insights, which will help understand the electrode characteristics for future bromine battery design.

Thus, research has been focused on developing silicon-based anodes due to their high theoretical capacity and natural abundance. However, silicon-based anodes still suffer from several drawbacks (e.g., a huge volume expansion during lithiation/delithiation and the low conductivity nature of silicon). In this study, we develop a facile and low-cost synthesis route to create a composite of silicon particles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via simple two-step mechanical ball milling with a silicon wafer as the silicon precursor. This method produces a strong interaction between silicon particles and the CNTs, forming Si–C bonds with minimum oxidation of silicon and pulverization of the CNTs. The resulting Si/CNT anode exhibits a first cycle Coulombic efficiency of 98.06%. It retains 71.28% of its first cycle capacity of 2470 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles of charge–discharge at a current density of 400 mA g −1 . Furthermore, the Si/CNT anode also shows a good rate capability by retaining 80.15%, and 94.56% of its first cycle capacity at a current density of 1000 mA g −1 and when the current density is reduced back to 200 mA g −1 , respectively.

However, the limited number of retired batteries and the trend in battery capacity increase hinder a realistic evaluation of second-life applications. To analyze battery reuse, a closer look at the End of Life (EoL) conditions of these batteries must be taken. This study presents a battery ageing model to estimate the SoH of EV batteries according to their age and mileage. The model is applied to the current retirement characteristics of combustion vehicles to statistically determine the expected SoH at the vehicle EoL. Results indicate that most EVs will reach EoL for reasons other than under-performance. Once retired, most EV batteries will have a SoH higher than 75% within the next 20 years, opening an interesting market for second-life businesses. However, battery reuse is an option that, considering the growing EV market, will rapidly saturate the stationary energy storage demand. Before 2040, most EV batteries will follow streams towards the circular economy, although at some point, they will have to be sent directly to recycling after the vehicular use. Full article"

This improved tubular-type simple test cell was supplemented from the setbacks of our previous test cell, such as a leak, Ni current collector wavering, and sodium wicking. Through testing of the improved test cells, we focus on cathode microstructure analysis, owing to the elimination of the external failure factors mentioned above. The group of improved test cells have a lower capacity gap of 9.5% in the 1st cycle than the capacity gap of previous test cells (37.2%). This result indicates the advancement of reproducibility. Moreover, the improved test cell has a long life of approximately 7200 h by changing the previous test cell structure.

The incorporation of embedded cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) in the tips of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can catalyze polysulfide transformation kinetics. In addition, the nanocages form a conductive three-dimensional spiderweb-like network that facilitates electrolytic penetration and electronic/ionic transportation. Moreover, the porous internal nano-cavities not only improve sulfur loading levels but also provide buffer space for volume expansion during charging and discharging. As a result, the hollow Co/Mel polyhedra with a high content of sulfur (75.5 wt%) displays outstanding electrochemical performance with an initial discharge-specific capacity of 1425.2 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C and a low decay rate of only 0.028% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

However, to achieve excellent LIC performance at high rates, along with cycling stability, an alternative anode to graphite is needed. Porous high-surface-area carbons, such as onion-like carbons (OLCs), have been recently found to hold high potential as high-rate-capable LIC anodes. However, a systematic understanding of their synthesis route and morphology is lacking. In this study, OLCs prepared from self-made metal organic frameworks (MOFs) Fe-BTC and Fe-MIL100 by a simple pyrolysis method were compared to OLCs obtained via high-temperature annealing of nanodiamonds. The LICs with OLCs produced from Fe-BTC achieved a maximum energy density of 243 Wh kg −1 and a power density of 20,149 W kg −1 . Furthermore, excellent capacitance retention of 78% after 10,000 cycles was demonstrated. LICs with MOF-derived OLCs surpassed the energy and power density of LICs with nanodiamond-derived OLCs. We determined the impact of the MOF precursor structure and morphology on the resulting OLC properties, as well as on the electrochemical performance. Thus, MOF-derived OLCs offer significant potential toward high-performance anode material for LICs, enabling control over structure and morphology, as well as easy scalability for industrial implementation.

Therefore, a trend to increase the overall size of the individual cell and to decrease the share of inactive materials is needed. The process of electrolyte filling involves the injection of electrolyte liquid into the cell, as well as the absorption of the electrolyte into the pores of the electrodes and the separator, which is known as wetting. The trend towards larger-format LIB challenges the electrolyte filling due to an increase in wetting distance for the electrolyte as well as a decrease in the void volume of the cell. The optimization of the process via numerical simulation promises to reduce costs and ensure quality during battery production. The two models developed in this study are based on a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to study the effect of process parameters, such as pressure and temperature, on the filling process. The results were verified with neutron radiography images of the dosing process and a feasibility study for a wetting simulation is shown. For all simulations, specific recommendations are provided to set up the electrolyte filling process, based on which factors generate the greatest improvement. Full article"

When the amounts of Ga 2 O 3 additive were below 2 mol %, the sintered sample has a dense structure composed of grains with an average size of 5 to 10 μm, whereas 3 mol % or more Ga 2 O 3 addition causes a significant increase in grain size above several 10 to 100 μm, due to high-temperature sintering with a large amount of liquid Li-Ga-O phase. At room temperature, the highest total (bulk + grain-boundary) ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm −1 was obtained in the sample with 5 mol % Ga 2 O 3 addition. However, this sample was shorted by Li dendrite growth into solid electrolyte at a current density below 0.2 mA cm −2 in galvanostatic testing of the symmetric cell with Li metal electrodes. The tolerance for Li dendrite growth is maximized in the sample sintered with 2 mol % Ga 2 O 3 addition, which was shorted at 0.8 mA cm −2 in the symmetric cell. Since the interfacial resistance between Li metal and solid electrolyte was nearly identical among all samples, the difference in tolerance for Li dendrite growth is primarily attributed to the difference in microstructure of sintered samples depending on the amounts of Ga 2 O 3 .

Therefore, developing high-efficiency and low-cost Na-ion batteries has become an alternative to energy storage systems. The high potential plateau of most anode materials urges the exploration of the ultimate anode, the Na metal anode. However, three big dilemmas regarding Na metal anodes, including the formation of Na dendrites, the formation of dead Na, and the continuous appearance of bare Na lead to the degradation of the performance of Na metal batteries (NMBs). In this review, we mainly summarize the recent progress to address these dilemmas for NMBs by electrolyte optimization. We firstly discuss the liquid electrolyte progresses to improve the Na metal anode’s electrochemical performance by solvent chemistry, salt chemistry, and additive. In addition, considering the ultimate goal of NMBs is solid-state batteries, we also discuss the recent progress of polymer electrolytes and all-solid-state electrolytes for Na metal anodes and summarize the enhancement of Na-ion transport mechanisms and interface engineering mechanisms of different solid-state electrolytes. Furthermore, the critical challenges and new perspectives of NMBs using electrolyte optimization are also emphasized. We believe that our review will provide insight to conduct more comprehensive and effective electrolyte engineering for high-performance NMBs. Full article"

MXene inherits the strengths of excellent metallic conductivity, a low lithium-ion diffusion potential barrier and superior mechanical stability; however, its low reversible capacity and self-stacking problems as anode still need to be solved. Herein, the MXene Ti 3 C 2 T x compound with MoS 2 through a simple one-step hydrothermal reaction is introduced. The introduction of nitrogen-doped Ti 3 C 2 T x can effectively restrain the volume change of MoS 2 and ameliorate the electronic conductivity of the whole electrode, while MoS 2 can alleviate the self-stacking of Ti 3 C 2 T x during cycling. The as-prepared MoS 2 /MXene electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1087 mA h g −1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 81.6% at 100 mA g −1 , and a specific discharge capacity of 731 mA h g −1 can be retained after 100 cycles.

In order to guarantee the safe operation of lithium-ion batteries, a hybrid model based on convolutional neural network (CNN)-bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and attention mechanism (AM) is developed to predict the SOH of lithium-ion batteries. By analyzing the charging and discharging process of batteries, the indirect health indicator (HI), which is highly correlated with capacity, is extracted in this paper. HI is taken as the input of CNN, and the convolution and pooling operations of CNN layers are used to extract the features of battery time series data. On this basis, a BiLSTM depth model is built in this paper to collect the data coming from CNN forward and reverse dependencies and further emphasize the correlation between the serial data by AM to obtain an accurate SOH estimate. Experimental results based on NASA PCoE lithium-ion battery data demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms other single models, with the root mean square error (RMSE) of SOH prediction results all less than 0.01, and can accurately predict the SOH of lithium-ion batteries.

In this study, a Si/C core/shell structure with engineered voids, termed Si@void@C, is investigated for its specific capacity and cycle stability as a function of particle size and charge/discharge protocol. The study shows that finer Si@void@C particles result in higher specific capacities, but with little impact on the cycle stability. Further, lower and upper cutoff voltages in charge/discharge have a profound impact on the specific capacity and cycle stability. Importantly, cutoff voltages in formation cycles have long-lasting effects on the cycle stability, indicating the critical role of forming a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer during formation cycles. Using a constant current charge followed by potentiostatic hold charge can further improve the cycle stability and minimize the sharp capacity decay in the first 20–40 cycles. With proper choices of charge/discharge protocols, the specific capacities of Si@void@C anodes at the electrode level are 66.8%, 38.2% and 22.7% higher than those of graphite anodes at the 1st, 300th and 500th cycles, respectively, proving that Si@void@C has promising potential to replace graphite anodes for practical applications in the future.

The accompanying zinc dendrites are an important problem that endangers the battery performance. Therefore, the extensive research on the suppression strategies of Zn dendrites reflects a positive effect on improving the performance of ZIBs. In particular, the electrolyte additives (EAs) approach is considered a simple, reliable, and low-cost strategy to address the zinc dendritic issues and can inhibit or alleviate the growth of zinc dendrites while facilitating the amelioration of adverse reactions. In this review, the principles and processes of zinc dendrites, corrosion passivation, and hydrogen evolution side reactions on zinc anodes of ZIBs are firstly categorized. Then, the mitigation and inhibition of zinc dendrites and side reactions via different kinds of EAs are elaborated according to the regulation strategies of EAs, which provides an overview of the research on EAs conducted in recent years and proposed strategies to solve zinc dendrites and other problems. Finally, a reasonable outlook on the future improvement and development of EAs for ZIBs is described, which could provide some guidance for the evolution and design of EAs in the future.

Improvement of Cycle Stability for Graphite-Based Lithium-Ion Batteries via Usage of Phenyl Methanesulfonate as an Electrolyte Additive,"Behrooz Mosallanejad, Mehran Javanbakht, Zahra Shariatinia, Mohammad Akrami",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8100152,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/152/pdf?version=1664687452,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/10/152,9,"In this work, phenyl methanesulfonate (PMS) is evaluated as an additive to enhance the cyclic stability of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) based on a graphite electrode. According to the theoretical results obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, PMS possesses a lower reduction potential compared to the cyclic carbonate electrolyte solvent. Hence, this compound is foreseen to be reduced before ethylene carbonate (EC) and form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the graphite electrode. The cyclic stability of Li/graphite battery is promoted considerably by adding a low dose of PMS to the electrolyte. The capacity retention of the Li/graphite half-cell is incredibly improved to about 100% after 35 cycles at room temperature. The results acquired from the electrochemical and surface characterization tests corroborate that an electrolyte with PMS is capable of forming a thinner SEI layer compared to the electrolyte devoid of an additive, which can dramatically lessen the interfacial resistance. Moreover, the results show that the graphite sheets are disguised under a myriad of PMS reductive deposits, which can neutralize the catalytic activity of prismatic surfaces. Full article"

Accurate state-of-health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation provides crucial information for improving the safety, reliability and longevity of batteries. In this paper, a fusion of deep-learning model and feature signal analysis methods are proposed to realize accurate and fast estimation of the health conditions for battery cathodes. Specifically, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and differential thermal voltammetry (DTV) are utilized to verify our fusion method. Firstly, the DTV feature signal analysis is executed based on battery charging and discharging data, based on which useful feature variables are extracted with Pearson correlation analysis. Next, the deep-learning model is constructed and trained with the LSTM as the core based on timeseries datasets constructed with features. Finally, the validation and error analysis of proposed model are provided, showing a max mean absolute error of 0.6%.

However, the ORR is kinetically sluggish, and expensive noble metal catalysts are required. The high price and limited preservation of noble metal catalysts has largely hindered the wide application of clean power sources such as fuel cells and MABs. Therefore, it is important to prepare non-expensive metal catalysts (NPMC) to cut the price of the fuel cells and MABs for wide application. Here, we report the preparation of a Co 3 O 4 carried on the N-doped carbon (Co/N-C) as the ORR NPMC with a facile Pharaoh’s Snakes reaction. The gas generated during the reaction is able to fabricate the porous structure of the resultant carbon doped with heteroatoms such as Co and N. The catalyst provides a high electrocatalytic activity towards ORR via the 4-e pathway with an onset and half-wave potential of 0.98 and 0.79 V (vs. RHE), respectively, in an electrolyte of 0.1 M KOH. The onset and half-wave potentials are close to those of the commercial Pt/C. This work demonstrates the promising potential of an ancient technology for preparing NPMCs toward the ORR. Full article"

Nowadays, two options can satisfy this claim: all-solid-state batteries and aqueous-electrolyte batteries. Commercially available Li-ion batteries utilize non-aqueous electrolytes (NAE) owing to a wide potential window (>3 V) that achieves high energy density but pose serious safety issues due to the high volatility, flammability, and toxicity of NAE. On the contrary, aqueous electrolytes are non-flammable, low-toxic, and have a low installation cost for humidity control in the production line. In this scenario, we develop a new aqueous rechargeable Li-ion full-cell composed of high-voltage cathode material as LiCoO 2 (LCO) and a safe nanostructured anode material as Li 2 TiO 3 (LTO). Both pure-phase LTO and LCO nanopowders are prepared by hydrothermal route and their structural and electrochemical properties are studied in detail. Simultaneously, the electrochemical performances of these electrodes are tested in both half- and full-cell configurations in presence of saturated 1 mole L −1 Li 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte medium. Pt//LCO and Pt//LTO half-cells deliver high discharge capacities of 142 and 133 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C rate with capacity retention of ~95% and 94% after 50 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.25% and 99.89%, respectively.

Rather than using complex partial differential equations and the complicated parameter tuning of a model-based method, a machine learning algorithm provides a new paradigm and has been increasingly applied to cloud big-data platforms. Although promising, it is now recognized that big data for machine learning may not be consistent in terms of data quality with reliable labels. Moreover, many algorithms are still applied as a black box that may not learn battery inner information well. To enhance the algorithm generalization in realistic situations, this paper presents a fractional-order physics-informed recurrent neural network (PIRNN) for state estimation. The fractional-order characteristics from battery mechanism are embedded into the proposed algorithm by introducing fractional-order gradients in backpropagation process and fractional-order constraints into the convergence loss function. With encoded battery knowledge, the proposed fractional-order PIRNN would accelerate the convergence speed in training process and achieve improved prediction accuracies. Experiments of four cells under federal urban driving schedule operation conditions and different temperatures are conducted to illustrate the estimation effects of the proposed fractional-order PIRNN. Compared to the integer-order gradient descent method, the fractional-order gradient descent method proposed in this work can optimize network convergence and obtains regression coefficient larger than 0.995. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve 2.5% estimation accuracy with the encoding fractional-order knowledge of lithium-ion batteries. Full article"

Typical physiochemical models include parameters such as porosity and tortuosity, which are not easily experimentally available; this model allows for model parameters such as the internal impedance to be easily estimated using more practical inputs. The paper models the internal impedance resistance of a LiFePO 4 battery at five different ambient temperatures (5, 15, 25, 35, 45 °C), at three different discharge rates (1C, 2C, 3C) and at three different SOHs (90%, 83%, 65%). The internal impedance surface fit experimental measurements with a Pearson coefficient of 0.945. Three thermal models were then created that implemented the internal resistance model. The first two thermal models were 0D models that did not include the influence of the thermal conductivity of the battery. The first model assumed simple heating through internal resistance and convection energy loss, while the second also included the Bernardi Reversible heat term. The final third model was a 2D model that included all previous heat source terms as well as tab heating. The 2D model was solved using a simple Euler method and finite center difference. The R 2 values for the 0D thermal models were 0.9964 and 0.9962 for the simple internal resistance and reversible heating models, respectively. The R 2 value for the 2D thermal model was 0.996.

They report the electric current caused by coupling the flow of electrons inside the electronically conducting electrode and the flow of ions in the adjacent ionically conducting phase. At equilibrium or rest, potential currents in both directions at the established dynamic equilibrium have the same absolute value: the net current is zero. This current describes the electrocatalytic activity of an electrode and is called the exchange current; with respect to the surface area, it is called the exchange current density. This study inspected the actually used surface areas because the reported activities may depend critically on the selection of this area. Charge transfer resistances corresponding to exchange currents I 0 were determined for a simple redox system using a platinum disc electrode with constant geometric surface area but variable roughness. At all studied degrees of roughness, changes in I 0 were found. With an electrochemically active surface area, exchange current densities j 0 could be calculated, but the obtained values showed a dependency on roughness that could not be accounted for by using this surface area instead of the geometric one. It is suggested that j 0 may be reported with respect to geometric surface area, but at least roughness data of the studied electrode should be provided. Full article"

In this study, a new method was derived for SOC estimation and a series of experiments were conducted covering five types of lithium-ion batteries with three kinds of cathode materials (i.e., LiFePO 4 , Li(Ni 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 )O 2 , and LiCoO 2 ), three test temperatures, and four real driving cycles to verify the proposed method. The test temperatures for battery operation ranges from −20 to 60 °C. Then, an adaptive machine learning (ML) framework based on the deep temporal convolutional network (TCN) and Coulomb counting method was proposed, and the structure of the estimation model was designed through the Taguchi method. The accuracy and generalizability of the proposed method were evaluated by calculating the estimation errors and their standard deviations (SDs), its average errors showed a decline of at least 49.66%, and its SDs showed a decline of at least 45.88% when compared to four popular ML methods. These traditional ML methods performed poor accuracy and stability at extreme temperatures (−20 and 60 °C) when compared to 25 °C, while the proposed adaptive method exhibited stable and high performances at different temperatures.

Considering the limitations presented by the current structure of the power grid, mostly highlighted by the accentuated integration of emerging technologies (ESS, renewables, electric vehicles, and electrical appliances that natively operate in dc), it is extremely pertinent to adopt new topologies, architectures, and paradigms. In particular, decentralized power systems, unified topologies, and correspondent control algorithms are representative of a new trend towards a reduction in the number of power converters. Thus, the developed solution is designed to operaSAVE-15te at a nominal power of 3.6 kW, with a switching frequency of 100 kHz, and in four operation modes concerning power flow: (i) solar PV panels to batteries (PV2B); (ii) solar PV panels to dc grid (PV2G); (iii) batteries to dc grid (B2G); (iv) dc grid to batteries (G2B). Moreover, a dual active bridge converter guarantees galvanic isolation, while two back-end dc–dc converters are responsible for interfacing solar PV panels and batteries. The experimental validation of the proposed unified power converter proves its application value to self-consumption production units. Full article"

However, the surface Li 2 CO 3 and/or LiOH passive layers which form when garnet is exposed to the air greatly reduce the enhancement effect of garnet on the composite electrolyte. Furthermore, compared with micro-size particles, nano-size garnet fillers exhibit a better effect on enhancing the performance of composite solid electrolytes. Nevertheless, inferior organic/inorganic interphase compatibility and high specific surface energy of nanofillers inevitably cause agglomeration, which severely hinders the effect of nanoparticles for promoting composite solid electrolytes. Herein, a cost-effective amphipathic 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane coupling agent is introduced to modify garnet fillers, which effectively expands the air stability of garnet and greatly improves the dispersion of garnet fillers in the polymer matrix. The well-dispersed garnet filler/polymer interface is intimate through the bridging effect of the silane coupling agent, resulting in boosted ionic conductivity (0.72 × 10 −4 S/cm at room temperature) of the composite electrolyte, enhanced stability against lithium dendrites (critical current density > 0.5 mA/cm 2 ), and prolonged cycling life of LFP/Li full cells.

Firstly, an LFP battery electrical model based on artificial intelligence is proposed to estimate the terminal voltage, and a thermal resistance model with an EKF estimation algorithm is established to assess the temperature distribution in the battery pack. Then, the electrical and thermal models are coupled, a closed-loop EKF algorithm is employed to estimate the battery SOC, and a fusion method is discussed. The coupled model is simulated under a given protocol and RAE can be obtained. Finally, based on the electrical–thermal coupling model and RAE calculation algorithm, a preheating method and constant power condition-based RAE estimation are discussed, and the thermal management strategy of the battery system under low temperature is formed. Results show that the estimation error of SOC can be controlled within 2% and RAE can be controlled within 4%, respectively.

Through an exploratory study of multiple cases, we analyzed the Brazilian lead-based vehicle battery chain by investigating two main manufacturers, two recycling companies, and eight distributors/retailers. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationships between the actors in the lead acid battery chain and identify the mechanisms that induce recycling programs, and to propose an explanatory framework. The results indicate that although the sustainability strategies of OEMs are implemented by regulatory mechanisms, the impacts of these strategies cascade among all agents in the supply chain, promoting a convergence between actions and relationships between actors from the perspective of the triple bottom line, highlighting variables for each dimension (economic, social, and environmental).

The results revealed that the O–Cl anti-site cluster was the lowest energy defect in this material. The LiCl Schottky was the second lowest energy defect process, and the Li Frenkel was higher—only by 0.06 eV—than the LiCl Schottky. The candidate dopants on the Li, Si and Cl were Na, Ge and F, respectively. Substituting Al on the Si site was an efficient way of increasing the amount of Li in this material. Incorporation of extra Li (up to three) was considered and this process was endothermic.

However, such a high voltage application leads to an unstable interface between NCM and liquid electrolytes. To stabilize the interface, the facile wet impregnation method has been developed to apply an ultra-thin Al 2 O 3 coating layer on the NCM particles. This coating layer was found to have a strong interaction with the NCM and resulted in Al-doped NCM at the surface structure of NCM. The change of surface structure can not only reduce the surface resistance of lithium diffusion of LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 (NCM523), but also stabilize the solid electrolyte interface between NCM523 and the electrolyte with the cut-off voltage of 4.5 V vs. Li/Li + . Compared to other coating methods, wet impregnation coating can provide an ultra-thin and uniform coating with surface doping on NCM particles. Furthermore, this scalable coating method can be applied to various electrode materials without adding much additional cost. Full article"

Potassium-ion hybrid supercapacitors (KIC) consist of an activated carbon capacitor-type positive electrode and a graphitic battery-type negative one working in an electrolyte based on potassium salt. Overcoming the inherent potassium problems (irreversible capacity, extensive volume expansion, dendrites formation), the non-reproducibility of the results was a major obstacle to the development of this KIC technology. To remedy this, the development of an adequate formation protocol was necessary. However, this revealed a cell-swelling phenomenon, a well-known issue whether for supercapacitors or Li-ion batteries. This phenomenon in the case of the KIC technology has been investigated through constant voltage (CV) tests and volume measurements. The responsible phenomena seem to be the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation at the negative electrode during the first use of the system and the perpetual decomposition of the electrolyte solvent at high voltage. Thanks to these results, a proper formation protocol for KICs, which offers good energy density (14 Wh·kg electrochemical core −1 ) with an excellent stability at fast charging rate, was developed.

However, safety issues arising from the inaccurate estimation and prediction of battery SOH have caused widespread concern in academic and industrial communities. In this paper, a method is proposed to build an accurate SOH prediction model for battery packs based on multi-output Gaussian process regression (MOGPR) by employing the initial cycle data of the battery pack and the entire life cycling data of battery cells. Firstly, a battery aging experimental platform is constructed to collect battery aging data, and health indicators (HIs) that characterize battery aging are extracted. Then, the correlation between the HIs and the battery capacity is evaluated by the Pearson correlation analysis method, and the HIs that own a strong correlation to the battery capacity are screened. Finally, two MOGPR models are constructed to predict the HIs and SOH of the battery pack. Based on the first MOGPR model and the early HIs of the battery pack, the future cycle HIs can be predicted. In addition, the predicted HIs and the second MOGPR model are used to predict the SOH of the battery pack. The experimental results verify that the approach has a competitive performance; the mean and maximum values of the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 1.07% and 1.42%, and 1.77% and 2.45%, respectively.

In this regard, rechargeable batteries such as lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries become critical in EV applications.

In this regard, the battery management system (BMS) is crucial for monitoring, handling, and improving the lifespan and reliability of this type of battery from cell to pack levels, particularly in EV applications. Accordingly, the BMS should control and monitor the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery system during the lifespan of the battery. In this article, the BMS definition, state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) methods, and battery fault detection methods were investigated as crucial aspects of the control strategy of Li-ion batteries for assessing and improving the reliability of the system. Moreover, for a clear understanding of the voltage behavior of the battery, the open-circuit voltage (OCV) at three ambient temperatures, 10 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C, and three different SoC levels, 80%, 50%, and 20%, were investigated. The results obtained showed that altering the ambient temperature impacts the OCV variations of the battery. For instance, by increasing the temperature, the voltage fluctuation at 45 °C at low SoC of 50% and 20% was more significant than in the other conditions. In contrast, the rate of the OCV at different SoC in low and high temperatures was more stable. Full article"

GAs from spent LIBs were converted to graphene oxide (GO) through a modified Hummers method. Then the prepared GO was applied to absorb methylene blue in dyeing wastewater under different reaction conditions. The experimental results indicate that GO can quickly and effectively adsorb methylene blue, which also exhibits thermal stability. The maximum adsorption capacity and removal rate are about 833.11 mg/g and 99.95%, respectively. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated; the adsorption process of GO is more consistent with the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic model while the isotherm is close to the Langmuir isotherm.

In particular, 3C-SiC monolayers oriented along the (1 1 0) crystallographic direction that could have symmetric surfaces have been poorly studied, as have the effects of surface passivation on their physical and electronic properties. In this work, we investigate the influence of lithium on the electronic properties of hydrogenated surfaces in 3C-SiC monolayers using density functional theory. We examine the electronic properties of surfaces fully passivated with hydrogen with those of surfaces fully passivated with lithium and those with mixed passivation. Our results show that only fully hydrogenated surfaces exhibit a direct band-gap, while the full Li, CH+SiLi, and H+Li c c passivations exhibit metallic behavior. The CLi+SiH, H+1LiC, and H+1LiSi passivation systems decrease the band-gap compared to the hydrogenated case and show an indirect band-gap. The formation energy of the system shows that the most stable arrangement is full-H, followed by H+1LiC, and the most unstable system is full-Li, which has a positive formation energy. Full article"

Here, we report an interconnected bead-like P2-type manganese-based oxide Na x Co y Mn 1−y O 2 (x = 0.66, y = 0.1) synthesized by electrospinning and subsequent heat treatment as a high-rate cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The employed strategy of one-dimensional morphological design with interconnected bead-like particles profusely enhances Na + diffusion pathways. This layered cathode material exhibits a stable and superior discharge capacity of 180.0 mAh g −1 at 50 mA g −1 compared to a bare cathode material synthesized via the sol–gel process. Further, a high capacity of 78.3 mAh g −1 was achieved, maintaining excellent capacity retention of 85.0% even after 500 insertion/desertion cycles implying robust Na + storage properties. High-rate tests also revealed promising electrochemical performances at C-rates as high as 5000 mA g −1 , affirming the potential of this layered cathode material for high-rate Na + storage. Additionally, full SIBs assembled with a Na x Co y Mn 1−y O 2 (x = 0.66, y = 0.1) cathode and a carbon nanofiber (CNF) anode exhibited a high cycle performance, retaining 96.3 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles at 300 mA g −1 .

Lithium-ion batteries are the most commonly used in the electric vehicle (EV) industry because of their high energy and power density and long life cycle. Liquid cooling provides superior performance with low power draw and high heat transfer coefficient. Two liquid cooling designs-the Linear Channel Design (LCD) and Helical Channel Design (HCD)-underwent multiple numerical and geometrical optimisations, where inlet mass flow rate, channel diameter, and inlet and outlet locations were analysed using CFD (computational fluid dynamics). The primary objectives were to maintain maximum temperatures and thermal uniformity within the operational limits derived from the literature. These were both achieved with the LCD using a mass flow rate of 7.50E-05 kgs −1 . The T max goal was met for the HCD but not the thermal uniformity goal. The LCD achieved 1.796 K lower in maximum temperature and 8.740 K lower in temperature difference compared to the HCD, proving itself superior in both metrics. The HCD required a higher mass flow rate than the LCD to regulate temperatures, resulting in an undesirably high power consumption. Full article"

In this study, both radial and axial compression deformation were produced experimentally to analyze their influence on the performance and safety of lithium-ion batteries. In the radial plate compression experiment, the battery was loaded to different displacements and then charge–discharge cycles were performed. It was found that the greater the deformation of the battery, the smaller the initial capacity and the faster the capacity decay. Under axial loading, the voltage of low state of charge (SOCs) batteries showed a clear step-drop phenomenon. The battery was compressed until the first voltage drop, loading was stopped, and the voltage gradually dropped to 0 V. For high-SOC lithium-ion batteries, there was almost no voltage step-down, and a small deformation could cause thermal runaway in the battery. The results showed that the small deformation in the radial direction only reduced the capacity of the battery, but had little impact on its safety, whereas a small deformation in the axial direction was more likely to cause an internal short circuit (ISC).

In this paper, by constructing an electrode–thermal model coupling solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth and lithium plating, the competition among different factors of capacity degradation under various ambient temperatures and C-rates are systematically analyzed. In addition, the most important cause of rapid degradation of LIBs under low temperatures are investigated, which reveal the change pattern of lithium plating with temperature and C-rate. The threshold value and kinetic law of lithium plating are determined, and a method of lithium-free control under high C-rate is proposed. Finally, by studying the average aging rate of LIBs, the reasons for the abnormal attenuation of cycle life at lower C-rates are ascertained. Through the chromaticity diagram of the expected life of LIBs under various conditions, the optimal fast strategy is explored, and its practical application in EVs is also discussed. This study can provide a useful reference for the development of high-performance and high-safety battery management systems to achieve fine management. Full article"
Simultaneous Strain and Temperature Discrimination in 18650 Li-ion Batteries Using Polarization-Maintaining Fiber Bragg Gratings,"Lucca Matuck, João Lemos Pinto, Carlos Marques, Micael Nascimento",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8110233,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/233/pdf?version=1668084277,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/233,25,"In this work, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network inscribed in a polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber is proposed to proceed with a multipoint simultaneous temperature and strain discrimination in different locations (positive and negative terminals, and middle) on a cylindrical Li-ion battery. The birefringence property of the PM fibers, together with FBG sensors, allowed such an application using only one fiber line fixed to the edges of the battery. The battery was subjected to two different charge/discharge cycles, one with nominal charging and discharging conditions (1.00 C and 1.13 C, respectively) and another with abusive conditions (1.88 C for charge and 2.39 C for discharge). The PM-FBG sensors registered maximum temperature and strain variations at the end of the abusive discharge process of the battery; the positive terminal achieved a 28.7 ± 0.3 °C temperature variation, while the center achieved 221 ± 10 με strain variation. The results indicate a different strain variation behavior in the middle location when compared to the negative and positive terminals, as well as a higher temperature variation in both terminals when compared to the middle location. The use of PM-FBG sensors successfully demonstrates their feasibility in locally tracking and discriminating strain and temperature shifts in a battery surface. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the application of PM-FBG sensors to monitor and discriminate critical safety parameters in Li-ion batteries. Full article"
What Differentiates Dielectric Oxides and Solid Electrolytes on the Pathway toward More Efficient Energy Storage?,"Antonio Nuno Guerreiro, Beatriz Arouca Maia, Hesham Khalifa, Manuela Carvalho Baptista, Maria Helena Braga",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8110232,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/232/pdf?version=1668158598,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/232,12,"Taking advantage of electrode thicknesses well beyond conventional dimensions allowed us to follow the surface plasmonic THz frequency phenomenon with vacuum wavelengths of 100 μm to 1 mm, only to scrutinize them within millimeters-thicknesses insulators. Here, we analyze an Al/insulator/Cu cell in which the metal electrodes-collectors were separated by a gap that was alternatively filled by SiO 2 , MgO, Li 2 O, Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 –NASICON, Li 1.5 Al 0.5 Ge 1.5 (PO 4 ) 3 –LAGP, and Li 2.99 Ba 0.005 ClO–Li + glass. A comparison was drawn using experimental surface chemical potentials, cyclic voltammetry (I-V plots), impedance spectroscopy, and theoretical approaches such as structure optimization, simulation of the electronic band structures, and work functions . The analysis reveals an unexpected common emergency from the cell’s materials to align their surface chemical potential, even in operando when set to discharge under an external resistor of 1842 Ω.cm insulator . A very high capability of the metal electrodes to vary their surface chemical potentials and specific behavior among dielectric oxides and solid electrolytes was identified. Whereas LAGP and Li 2 O behaved as p-type semiconductors below 40 °C at OCV and while set to discharge with a resistor in agreement with the Li + diffusion direction, NASICON behaved as a quasi n-type semiconductor at OCV, as MgO, and as a quasi p-type semiconductor while set to discharge. The capacity to behave as a p-type semiconductor may be related to the ionic conductivity of the mobile ion. The ferroelectric behavior of Li 2.99 Ba 0.005 ClO has shown surface plasmon polariton (SPP) waves in the form of surface propagating solitons, as in complex phenomena, as well as electrodes’ surface chemical potentials inversion capabilities (i.e., χ (Al) − χ (Cu) > 0 to χ (Al) − χ (Cu) < 0 vs. E vacuum = 0 eV) and self-charge (ΔV cell ≥ +0.04 V under a 1842 Ω.cm insulator resistor). The multivalent 5.5 mm thick layer cell filled with Li 2.99 Ba 0.005 ClO was the only one to display a potential bulk difference of 1.1 V. The lessons learned in this work may pave the way to understanding and designing more efficient energy harvesting and storage devices. Full article"

High-Performance and Low-Cost Membranes Based on Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and Cardo-Poly(etherketone) Blends for Vanadium Redox Flow Battery Applications,"Tong Mu, Shifan Leng, Weiqin Tang, Ning Shi, Guorui Wang, Jingshuai Yang",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8110230,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/230/pdf?version=1668066362,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/230,12,"Energy storage systems have aroused public interest because of the blooming development of intermittent renewable energy sources. Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are the typical candidates owing to their flexible operation and good cycle durability. However, due to the usage of perfluorinated separator membranes, VRFBs suffer from both high cost and serious vanadium ions cross penetration. Herein, we fabricate a series of low-budget and high-performance blend membranes from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and cardo-poly(etherketone) (PEKC) for VFRB. A PEKC network gives the membrane excellent mechanical rigidity, while PVP endows the blend membranes with superior sulfonic acid uptake owing to the present N-heterocycle and carbonyl group in PVP, resulting in low area resistance. Meanwhile, blend membranes also display low vanadium ion permeability resulting from the electrostatic repulsion effect of protonated PVP polymer chains towards vanadium ions. Consequently, the 50%PVP-PEKC membrane has a high ionic selectivity of 1.03 × 10 6 S min cm −3 , while that of Nafion 115 is nearly 17 times lower (6.03 × 10 4 S min cm −3 ). The VRFB equipped with 50%PVP-PEKC membrane has high coulombic efficiencies (99.3–99.7%), voltage efficiencies (84.6–67.0%) and energy efficiencies (83.9–66.8%) at current densities of 80–180 mA cm −2 , and possesses excellent cycle constancy, indicating that low-cost x%PVP-PEKC blend membranes have a great application potentiality for VRFBs.

By monitoring the terminal voltage, current and temperature, BMS can evaluate the status of the Li-ion batteries and manage the operation of cells in a battery pack, which is fundamental for the high efficiency operation of EVs and smart grids. Battery capacity estimation is one of the key functions in the BMS, and battery capacity indicates the maximum storage capability of a battery which is essential for the battery State-of-Charge (SOC) estimation and lifespan management. This paper mainly focusses on a review of capacity estimation methods for BMS in EVs and RES and provides practical and feasible advice for capacity estimation with onboard BMSs. In this work, the mechanisms of Li-ion batteries capacity degradation are analyzed first, and then the recent processes for capacity estimation in BMSs are reviewed, including the direct measurement method, analysis-based method, SOC-based method and data-driven method. After a comprehensive review and comparison, the future prospective of onboard capacity estimation is also discussed. This paper aims to help design and choose a suitable capacity estimation method for BMS application, which can benefit the lifespan management of Li-ion batteries in EVs and RESs. Full article"
An Experimental Study of Power Smoothing Methods to Reduce Renewable Sources Fluctuations Using Supercapacitors and Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Dario Benavides, Paul Arévalo, Marcos Tostado-Véliz, David Vera, Antonio Escamez, José A.

This problem has motivated the development of new power smoothing techniques using supercapacitors and batteries. However, experimental studies based on multiple renewable sources (photovoltaic, wind, hydrokinetic) that demonstrate the validity of power smoothing techniques under real conditions still require further study. For this reason, this article presents a feasibility study of a renewable grid-connected system, addressing various aspects based on power quality and energy management. The first of them is related to the fluctuations produced by the stochastic characteristics of renewable sources and demand. Two power smoothing algorithms are presented (ramp rate and moving average) combining photovoltaic, wind, and hydrokinetic sources with a hybrid storage system composed of supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. Then, the self-consumption for an industrial load is analyzed by studying the energy flows between the hybrid renewable energy sources and the grid. The main novelty of this paper is the operability of the supercapacitor. The experimental results show that when applying the power smoothing ramp rate method, the supercapacitor operates fewer cycles with respect to the moving average method. This result is maintained by varying the capacity of the renewable sources. Moreover, by increasing the capacity of photovoltaic and wind renewable sources, the hybrid storage system requires a greater capacity only of supercapacitors, while by increasing the capacity of hydrokinetic turbines, the battery requirement increases considerably. Finally, the cost of energy and self-consumption reach maximum values by increasing the capacity of the hydrokinetic turbines and batteries. Full article"

Hereby, we proposed a novel illumination-assisted Na–O 2 battery in which bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) with few defects and high surface areas was used as the catalyst. It showed that the charge overpotential under photo assistance reduced by 1.11 V compared with that of the dark state one. Additionally, the insolating sodium oxide discharge products were completely decomposed, which was the key to running Na–O 2 batteries over 200 cycles with a charge potential of no more than 3.65 V, while its counterpart (under dark condition) at 200 cycles had the charge potential higher than 4.25 V. The experiment combined with theoretical calculation shows that few defects, high surface areas, the altered electron transfer kinetics, and the low energy gap and low oxygen absorption energy of the (040) crystal face of monoclinic BiVO 4 play an important role in catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

The problem of the poor wettability of Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 by metallic Li can be solved by using Li-In alloys as anode materials. Li-In alloys with different Li contents (40–90 at%) were prepared by an in situ method and investigated in symmetric cells with a Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 -based solid electrolyte. The interface resistance between the Li-In alloy (90 at% Li) and solid electrolyte is equal to ~11 Ω cm 2 at 200 °C. The cells with 80–90 at% Li in the Li-In anode show stable behavior during cycling with an applied current of ±8 mA (40 mA cm −2 ). No degradation of the Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 -based solid electrolyte in contact with the lithium–indium alloy was observed after galvanostatic cycling. Therefore, the Li-In alloy obtained by our in situ method can be applied as an anode material with Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 -based solid electrolyte in lithium power sources. Full article"

The internal short circuit (ISC) of lithium-ion batteries is regarded as one of the main reasons for the lithium-ion batteries failure. However, the online ISC diagnosis algorithm for real vehicle data remains highly imperfect at present. Based on the onboard data from the cloud battery management system (BMS), this work proposes an ISC diagnosis algorithm for battery packs with high accuracy and high robustness via voltage anomaly detection. The mean-difference model (MDM) is applied to characterize large battery packs. A diagram of the adaptive integrated prediction algorithm combining MDM and a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network is firstly proposed to approach the voltage prediction of each cell. The diagnosis of an ISC is realized based on the residual analysis between the predicted and the actual state. The experimental data in DST conditions evaluate the proposed algorithm by comparing it with the solo equivalent circuit-based prediction algorithm and the Bi-LSTM based prediction algorithm. Finally, through the practical vehicle data from the cloud BMS, the diagnosis and pre-warn ability of the proposed algorithm for an ISC and thermal runaway (TR) in batteries are verified. The ISC diagnosis algorithm that is proposed in this paper can effectively identify the gradual ISC process in advance of it. Full article"

In brief, porous materials as positive electrodes provide distinctive features such as faster electron transport, shorter ion diffusion distance, and richer electroactive reaction sites, which improve the kinetics of positive electrode reactions and achieve higher rate capacity. On the other hand, the porous structures as negative electrodes also exhibit electrochemical properties possessing higher surface area and reducing local current density, which favors the uniform Zn deposition and restrains the dendrite formation. In view of their advantages, porous electrode materials for ZIB are expected to be extensively applied in electric and hybrid electric vehicles and portable electronic devices.

Various methods, either in the time domain or frequency domain, have been proposed to identify the parameters of the p2D model. While the methods in each domain bring their advantages and disadvantages, a comprehensive comparison regarding parameter identifiability and accuracy is still missing. In this present work, some selected physicochemical parameters of the p2D model are identified in four different cases and with different methods, either only in the time domain or with a combined model. Which parameters are identified in the frequency domain is decided by a comprehensive analysis of the analytical expression for the DRT spectrum. Finally, the parameter identifiability results are analyzed and the validation results with two highly dynamic load profiles are shown and compared. The results indicate that the model with ohmic resistance and the combined method achieves the best performance and the average voltage error is at the level of 12 mV. Full article"

Despite in-depth knowledge of battery degradation at the chemical level, the kinetics of the degradation at the resolution of the individual elements of the cathode are not fully understood. Here, we studied lithiation kinetics in commercial cathodes based on lithium manganese spinel using the electrochemical strain microscopy local method. Supported by the experimental finding, the “viscous fingers” model of lithium ions intercalation–deintercalation in individual particles of the cathode was proposed. The non-linear dynamics of the lithiation front were suggested to be stimulated by the non-uniform stress field and gradient of the chemical potential. Irregularity of the lithiation front causes the formation of the residual lithiated pocket in the delithiated particles, which effectively reduces the volume available for chemical reaction. The obtained results shed further light on the degradation of the lithium battery cathodes and can be applicable for other cathode materials. Full article"

An Experimental Study on the Cell Balancing Parameters for Faulty Cell Detection in a Battery Module,"Woongchul Choi, Sungsoo Hong",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8110218,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/218/pdf?version=1667626979,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/218,3,"Along with global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint, electrification of powertrains is occurring in various applications, certainly including transportation systems. One of the most important components is an electric energy storage system, i.e., a battery pack. Regardless of battery form factors, such as cylindrical, pouch and prismatic type, it is critical to maintain the safety of the battery module/pack by monitoring the conditions of each and every battery cell of the battery pack. It becomes even more critical as the battery cells are used over many charging and discharging cycles. Thermal runaways of the battery packs can even be triggered by a single faulty battery cell which degrades in an unexpected manner and speed compared to the neighboring battery cells, resulting in extreme fire hazards. Typically, this faulty cell with an abnormally increased internal resistance can be detected using a voltage sensor or a temperature sensor. However, in this study, instead of depending on those sensors, activities of cell balancing switching devices are used to identify a degraded cell compared to other cells in a relative manner. A currently proposed faulty cell detection algorithm was developed through multiple simulations with Matlab Simulink ® , then, a simple BMS prototype was built and tested as a proof of concept.

Characteristic Prediction and Temperature-Control Strategy under Constant Power Conditions for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Junfu Li, Shaochun Xu, Changsong Dai, Ming Zhao, Zhenbo Wang",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8110217,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/217/pdf?version=1667564712,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/217,6,"Accurate characteristic prediction under constant power conditions can accurately evaluate the capacity of lithium-ion battery output. It can also ensure safe use for new-energy vehicles and electrochemical energy storage. As the battery voltage continues to drop under constant power conditions, the battery current output will accordingly increase, which brings a risk of thermal runaway in instances of weak heat dissipation. Therefore, knowing how to control the battery temperature is very critical for safe use. At present, the model-based method for characteristic prediction and temperature control has been used by most scholars, and that is also the key to this method. This work firstly extends a cell model to a pack-based electrochemical two-dimensional thermal coupling model, considering the heterogeneity of different cells inside the pack, and obtains the model parameters for a prismatic lithium-ion battery with a rated capacity of 42 Ah. Characteristic prediction under constant power conditions is then conducted based on an iterative solution method. Validations of characteristic prediction indicate the convenience of the developed models, with average absolute errors of voltage and temperature less than 36 mV and 0.4 K, respectively, and power error less than 0.005%. Finally, two model-based temperature feed-forward control strategies with lower cooling costs and shorter prediction times were developed based on the battery characteristic predictions, which leaves room for further controller development.

The heat transfer during the battery thermal runaway provides insight into thermal propagation. A better understanding of the heat exchange process improves a safer design and enhances battery thermal management performance. This work proposes a three-dimensional thermal model for the battery pack simulation by applying an in-house model to study the internal battery thermal propagation effect under the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation framework. The simulation results were validated with the experimental data. The detailed temperature distribution and heat transfer behaviour were simulated and analyzed. The thermal behaviour and cooling performance were compared by changing the abnormal heat generation locations inside the battery pack. The results indicated that various abnormal heat locations disperse heat to the surrounding coolant and other cells. According to the current battery pack setups, the maximum temperature of Row 2 cases can be increased by 2.93%, and the temperature difference was also increased. Overall, a new analytical approach has been demonstrated to investigate several stipulating battery thermal propagation scenarios for enhancing battery thermal performances. Full article"

However, the limited lifespans, as well as the frequent charging or replacement requirements, pose a set of challenges for their application in the Internet of things (IoTs), because the full power of the IoTs can only be realized by the sustainable operation of physical objects, especially embedded sensors, for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems continually in real-time. A viable option for achieving the sustainability of the IoTs may be the combination of renewable energy harvesting technologies such as triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with electrochemical energy storage technologies, where TENGs can harvest mechanical energies from ambient environments and transform them into electricity for charging electrochemical batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) conveniently, thus developing a new type of TENG-based uninterrupted power supply (TENG-UPS). In this review, we begin from a brief description of the operating mode of TENG and the integration strategy of TENG-UPS. The latest advances in the TENG-UPS are then thoroughly discussed from the perspective of structural design and system integration. Cutting edge developments of the as-designed self-powered sensing systems are then concisely illustrated to disclose the application potential in the IoTs. The main obstacles and future prospects for developing TENG-UPS-based intelligent systems are also highlighted in terms of design and manufacture at the conclusion. We expect this review will appropriately shine a light on the understanding of the key role of electrochemical energy storage devices in the development of TENG-based energy harvesting technology as well as the self-powered intelligent systems.

Sophisticated battery management systems (BMS) therefore constantly monitor their characteristics and varying states, to keep the battery within desired operational conditions and to mitigate safety risks as well as excessive degradation. However, there can be several situations where the battery is not in normal operation (e.g., a stand-alone battery) and a fully functional BMS monitoring function is not available. When necessary to interact with the system, its safety state must be deduced to ensure the safety of interactors. This can be a challenging task depending on a situation’s characteristics (time pressure, technical knowledge of involved people). Thus, this article discusses how the safety state of electric vehicle batteries can be evaluated quickly even by untrained people. To develop a solution, different scenarios, which require a battery’s state assessment, and the options for collecting relevant information are motivated and discussed, respectively. Finally, a mobile interface that can evaluate and display the safety state by using BMS-internal data is described and demonstrated. Full article"
“In Situ” Formation of Zn Anode from Bimetallic Cu-Zn Alloy (Brass) for Dendrite-Free Operation of Zn-Air Rechargeable Battery,"Tibor Nagy, Lajos Nagy, Zoltán Erdélyi, Eszter Baradács, György Deák, Miklós Zsuga, Sándor Kéki",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8110212,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/212/pdf?version=1668135173,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/212,13,"In this article, the performance of brass electrode was investigated in a Zn-air (charcoal-based cathode) rechargeable battery. The construction of the battery was carried out with biodegradable materials, namely a cotton cloth diaphragm and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na) viscosity modifier, while the battery skeleton was printed by 3D printing technology. The brass acted as a collector and a preferable surface for the metallic Zn deposition on the brass anode surface. The electrochemical behavior of the brass anode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Cyclic performance tests were carried out, which showed stable cell operation even in the presence or absence of additives up to more than 100 cycles. Furthermore, high energy (E eff ) and Coulomb (C eff ) efficiencies, 80% (E eff ), 95% (C eff ), 75% (E eff ), and 95% (C eff ) were obtained, respectively. The Shepherd model was applied to describe the discharging processes of the Zn-air battery containing brass as anode in the presence of additive-free electrolyte or electrolyte with CMC-Na salt additive. It was found that the Shepherd equation described only approximately the resulting discharge curves. In order to attain a more precise mathematical description, stretched exponential function was implemented into the last term of the Shepherd equation. The need for such a correction shows the complexity of the electrochemical processes occurring in these systems. In addition, the surface of the brass anode was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the composition of the brass alloys was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). Importantly, the formation of dendritic deposition was successfully suppressed and a smooth and uniform surface was obtained after the cycling tests. Full article"

CR2032-type half- and full-cells were assembled to evaluate the electrochemical LIB anode behavior. The galvanostatic measurements of half-cell configurations revealed that the composite anode with an 8:2 HC/N-Si mass ratio exhibited a high capacity (531 mAh g −1 ) at 0.1 C and superior current-rate dependence (rate performance) at 0.1–10 C. To evaluate the practical LIB anode performance, the optimally performing composite anode was used in the full cell. Prior to full-cell assembly, the composite anodes were prelithiated via electrochemical Li doping at different cutoff anodic specific capacities (200–600 mAh g −1 ). The composite anode was paired with a LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 cathode to construct full-cells, the performance of which was evaluated by conducting sequential rate and cycling performance tests. Prelithiation affected only the cycling performance, without affecting the rate performance. Excellent capacity retention was observed in the full-cells with prelithiation conducted at cutoff anodic specific capacities greater than or equal to 500 mAh g −1 . Full article"

Within such a framework, the lithium-ion battery plays a key role in the energy scenario, and the reduction of lifetime due to the cell degradation during its usage is bound to be a topical challenge. The aim of this work is to estimate the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion battery cells with satisfactory accuracy and low computational cost. This would allow the battery management system (BMS) to guarantee optimal operation and extended cell lifetime. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms proved to be a promising data-driven modelling technique for the cell SOH prediction due to their great suitability and low computational demand. An accurate on-board SOH estimation is achieved through the identification of an optimal SOC window within the cell charging process. Several Bi-LSTM networks have been trained through a random-search algorithm exploiting constant current constant voltage (CCCV) test protocol data. Different analyses have been performed and evaluated as a trade-off between prediction performance (in terms of RMSE and customized accuracy) and computational burden (in terms of memory usage and elapsing time). Results reveal that the battery state of health can be predicted by a single-layer Bi-LSTM network with an error of 0.4% while just monitoring 40% of the entire charging process related to 60–100% SOC window, corresponding to the constant-voltage (CV) phase. Finally, results show that the amount of memory used for data logging and processing time has been cut by a factor of approximately 2.3. Full article"

In addition to its reversible chemistry in aqueous electrolytes, Zn metal is stable in water and air. However, there are critical challenges, such as non-uniform plating, hydrogen evolution, corrosion, and the formation of a passivation layer, which must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, the surface of Zn metal was coated with room-temperature bulk liquid-metal and liquid-metal nanoparticles to facilitate the uniform plating of Zn–ions during cycling. A simple probe ultrasonication method was used to prepare the liquid-metal nanoparticles, and a nanoparticle suspension film was formed through spin coating. At an areal capacity and current density of 0.5 mAh cm −2 and 0.5 mA cm −2 , respectively, symmetric cells composed of bare Zn metal electrodes were prone to short-circuiting after ~45 h of deposition/striping cycles. However, under the same operating conditions, symmetric cells employing the room-temperature liquid-metal-coated electrodes operated stably for more than 500 h. Compared to the symmetric cell with bare Zn, the symmetric cell with the bulk liquid-metal coated electrode exhibited a significant reduction in the initial nucleation barrier, with respective values of 113.2 and 10.1 mV. Electrochemical characterization of practical full cells also showed significant improvements in the capacity and cycling performance derived from the room-temperature liquid-metal coating.

In the following manuscript, various experimental precautions are outlined to reduce experimental artefacts. Original experimental measurements on vanadium flow cells, together with data from the literature, are examined to explore efficiencies and two alternative benchmarking metrics: resistivity and self-discharge current density. The sensitivity of these parameters to current density, temperature, flow rate and state-of-charge range are examined, from which it is concluded that resistivity and self-discharge current density exhibit superior properties to efficiencies for quantifying flow battery improvements.

This work introduces a methodology to track Li-ion cells degradation and estimate SoH based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Distribution of relaxation times (DRT) were exploited to derive indicators linked to the so-called degradation modes (DMs), which group the different aging mechanisms. The combination of these indicators was used to model the aging progression over the whole lifetime (both in the “pre-knee” and “after-knee” regions), enabling a physics-based SoH estimation. The methodology was applied to commercial cylindrical cells (NMC811|Graphite SiO x ). The results showed that loss of lithium inventory (LLI) is the main driving factor for cell degradation, followed by loss of cathode active material (LAM C ). SoH estimation was achievable with a mean absolute error lower than 0.75% for SoH values higher than 85% and lower than 3.70% SoH values between 85% and 80% (end of life). The analyses of the results will allow for guidelines to be defined to replicate the presented methodology, characterize new Li-ion cell types, and perform onboard SoH estimation in battery management system (BMS) solutions.

First, the Extended Volume Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (EV-ARC) test was performed using the cell with an internal implantation thermocouple for a comparative study. Three abuse methods were used to induce TR and TRP for the cells and modules. At the cell level, the maximum temperature inside the cell under the EV-ARC test, nail penetration, and side-heating abuse was 994.8 °C, 964.3 °C, and 1020 °C, respectively. The thermocouple inside the cell under the overcharge abuse test was broken, and the experimental phenomenon indicated that the cell was most severely damaged under the overcharging abuse test. At the module level, the TRP behavior using the three abuse methods was different than in the first two TR cells, while the behavior of the other cells was similar. It was evidenced that TRP triggered by the overcharge abuse was the most hazardous, followed by the side-heating abuse, and lastly, the nail-penetration abuse was the least. Full article"

Electrochemical models are widely used in battery diagnostics and charging/discharging control, considering their high extractability and physical interpretability. Many artificial intelligence charging algorithms also use electrochemical models for to enhance operation efficiency and maintain a higher state of health. However, the parameter identification of electrochemical models is challenging due to the complicated model structure and the high count of physical parameters to be considered. In this manuscript, a comprehensive electrochemical lithium-ion battery model is proposed for the charging and discharging processes. The proposed model accounts for all dynamic characteristics of the battery, including the cell open-circuit voltage, cell voltage, internal battery impedance, charging/discharging current, and temperature. The key novelty of the proposed model is the use of simulated open-circuit voltage and simulated changes in entropy data instead of experimental data to provide battery voltage and temperature profiles during charging and discharging cycles in the development of the final model. An available experimental dataset at NASA for an LCO 18,650 battery was utilized to test the proposed model. The mean absolute error for the simulated charging cell voltage and temperature values were 0.05 V and 0.3 °C, compared with 0.14 V and 0.65 °C for the discharging profile. The simulation results proved the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, while simplicity was the key factor in developing the final model, as shown in the subsequent sections of the manuscript.

A Novel Stochastic Mixed-Integer-Linear-Logical Programming Model for Optimal Coordination of Hybrid Storage Systems in Isolated Microgrids Considering Demand Response,"Marcos Tostado-Véliz, Ali Asghar Ghadimi, Mohammad Reza Miveh, Daniel Sánchez-Lozano, Antonio Escamez, Francisco Jurado",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8110198,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/198/pdf?version=1667879807,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/11/198,11,"Storage systems and demand-response programs will play a vital role in future energy systems. Batteries, hydrogen or pumped hydro storage systems can be combined to form hybrid storage facilities to not only manage the intermittent behavior of renewable sources, but also to store surplus renewable energy in a practice known as ‘green’ storage. On the other hand, demand-response programs are devoted to encouraging a more active participation of consumers by pursuing a more efficient operation of the system. In this context, proper scheduling tools able to coordinate different storage systems and demand-response programs are essential. This paper presents a stochastic mixed-integer-lineal-logical framework for optimal scheduling of isolated microgrids. In contrast to other works, the present model includes a logical-based formulation to explicitly coordinate batteries and pumped hydro storage units. A case study on a benchmark isolated microgrid serves to validate the developed optimization model and analyze the effect of applying demand-response premises in microgrid operation. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the developed method, and it is found that operation cost and fuel consumption can be reduced by ~38% and ~82% by applying demand-response initiatives.

The overall system efficiency of this high-temperature battery can be increased by optimizing the thermal management system. This paper addresses the integration of a phase change material (PCM) into the battery modules and evaluates the thermal performance and environmental impact of such a design. The module layout with PCM and heat transfer elements (HTEs) was selected based on 2D FEM simulation results and verified in a prototype Na/NiCl 2 module. It was shown that the module temperatures could be kept within the operating limits during operation by the HTEs and the PCM even at high current rates. Since no critical temperature limits were reached, the usable battery capacity was higher compared to results of a reference module without PCM or HTEs. In addition, the PCM prolonged the cooling down process after discharge. In parallel with the experimental studies, the environmental performance of the battery was evaluated using a life cycle assessment (LCA). Amongst other things, it was found that the application of PCM is also beneficial from an ecological point of view. Full article"

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are an excellent solution for energy storage due to their properties. In order to ensure the safety and efficient operation of LIB systems, battery management systems (BMSs) are required. The current design and functionality of BMSs suffer from a few critical drawbacks including low computational capability and limited data storage. Recently, there has been some effort in researching and developing smart BMSs utilizing the cloud platform. A cloud-based BMS would be able to solve the problems of computational capability and data storage in the current BMSs. It would also lead to more accurate and reliable battery algorithms and allow the development of other complex BMS functions. This study reviews the concept and design of cloud-based smart BMSs and provides some perspectives on their functionality and usability as well as their benefits for future battery applications. The potential division between the local and cloud functions of smart BMSs is also discussed. Cloud-based smart BMSs are expected to improve the reliability and overall performance of LIB systems, contributing to the mass adoption of renewable energy. Full article"

The proposed charging algorithm is able to find an optimized charging current profile, through ANNs, considering the real-time conditions of the Li-ion batteries. To test and validate the proposed approach, a low-cost battery management system (BMS) was developed, supporting up to 168 cells in series and n cells in parallel. When compared with the multistage charging algorithm, the proposed charging algorithm revealed a shorter charging time (7.85%) and a smaller temperature increase (32.95%). Thus, the results show that the proposed algorithm based on AI is able to effectively charge and balance batteries and can be regarded as a subject of interest for future research. Full article"
Effect of Internal AC Heating on the Temperature Homogeneity of Different Size Battery Cells,"Howard Richards, Christopher Vagg",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8020017,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/2/17/pdf?version=1644993979,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/2/17,6,"Rapidly warming up batteries is an important challenge both for conventional lithium-ion batteries, which operate best over 15 °C, and for most solid-state batteries, which currently require operating temperatures over 60 °C. Internal heating using an alternating current (AC) has been proposed as a possible solution in automotive applications, with faster heating rates possible than conventional external heating methods. This paper investigates the performance of internal AC heating on cells of different sizes, for both cylindrical and pouch formats. A novel experimental arrangement is used in which two cells are tested in series while connected with opposing polarity to create a zero-voltage string, allowing the use of less expensive testing equipment. The results show that larger cells exhibit a considerably greater distribution of surface temperature than smaller format cells during internal heating. This is likely due to the more extreme spatial variation in current density in the current collectors, causing an uneven distribution of internal heat generation. This highlights a significant difference compared to external heating methods, which are not affected by this, and has important implications for temperature measurement and battery management if this type of internal heating is to be used, since temperature sensors must be placed in hot spots or supplemented by validated models to ensure all parts of the battery stay within safe temperature limits.

Radial Thermal Conductivity Measurements of Cylindrical Lithium-Ion Batteries—An Uncertainty Study of the Pipe Method,"Markus Koller, Johanna Unterkofler, Gregor Glanz, Daniel Lager, Alexander Bergmann, Hartmut Popp",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8020016,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/2/16/pdf?version=1645059152,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/2/16,9,"A typical method for measuring the radial thermal conductivity of cylindrical objects is the pipe method. This method introduces a heating wire in combination with standard thermocouples and optical Fiber Bragg grating temperature sensors into the core of a cell. This experimental method can lead to high uncertainties due to the slightly varying setup for each measurement and the non-homogenous structure of the cell. Due to the lack of equipment on the market, researchers have to resort to such experimental methods. To verify the measurement uncertainties and to show the possible range of results, an additional method is introduced. In this second method the cell is disassembled, and the thermal conductivity of each cell component is calculated based on measurements with the laser flash method and differential scanning calorimetry. Those results are used to numerically calculate thermal conductivity and to parameterize a finite element model. With this model, the uncertainties and problems inherent in the pipe method for cylindrical cells were shown. The surprising result was that uncertainties of up to 25% arise, just from incorrect assumption about the sensor position. Furthermore, the change in radial thermal conductivity at different states of charge (SOC) was measured with fully functional cells using the pipe method. Full article"
Combined Thermal Runaway Investigation of Coin Cells with an Accelerating Rate Calorimeter and a Tian-Calvet Calorimeter,"Wenjiao Zhao, Magnus Rohde, Ijaz Ul Mohsin, Carlos Ziebert, Yong Du, Hans J.

After cycling and charging to the selected states of charge (SOCs), the cells were studied under thermal abuse conditions using the heat-wait-seek (HWS) method with the heating step of 5 K and a threshold for self-heating detection of 0.02 K/min. The onset temperature and the rate of the temperature rise, i.e., the self-heating rate for thermal runaway events, were determined. The morphology of the positive electrode, negative electrode and the separator of fresh and tested cells were compared and investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the microstructure and the chemical compositions of the individual components were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), respectively. In the Tian-Calvet calorimeter, the coin cells with the selected SOCs and the individual components (positive electrode, negative electrode and separator) were heated up with a constant heating rate of 0.1 °C/min (ramp heating mode). Simultaneously, the heat flow signals were recorded to analyze the heat generation. The combination of the three different methods—the HWS method using the ES-ARC, ramp heating mode on both cells and the individual components using the Tian-Calvet calorimeter—together with a post-mortem analysis, give us a complete picture of the processes leading to thermal runaway.

Quantitative Lithiation Depth Profiling in Silicon Containing Anodes Investigated by Ion Beam Analysis,"Sören Möller, Hyunsang Joo, Marcin Rasinski, Markus Mann, Egbert Figgemeier, Martin Finsterbusch",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8020014,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/2/14/pdf?version=1644314798,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/2/14,3,"The localisation and quantitative analysis of lithium (Li) in battery materials, components, and full cells are scientifically highly relevant, yet challenging tasks. The methodical developments of MeV ion beam analysis (IBA) presented here open up new possibilities for simultaneous elemental quantification and localisation of light and heavy elements in Li and other batteries. It describes the technical prerequisites and limitations of using IBA to analyse and solve current challenges with the example of Li-ion and solid-state battery-related research and development. Here, nuclear reaction analysis and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry can provide spatial resolutions down to 70 nm and 1% accuracy. To demonstrate the new insights to be gained by IBA, SiO x -containing graphite anodes are lithiated to six states-of-charge (SoC) between 0–50%. The quantitative Li depth profiling of the anodes shows a linear increase of the Li concentration with SoC and a match of injected and detected Li-ions. This unambiguously proofs the electrochemical activity of Si. Already at 50% SoC, we derive C/Li = 5.4 (< LiC 6 ) when neglecting Si, proving a relevant uptake of Li by the 8 atom % Si (C/Si ≈ 9) in the anode with Li/Si ≤ 1.8 in this case. Extrapolations to full lithiation show a maximum of Li/Si = 1.04 ± 0.05. The analysis reveals all element concentrations are constant over the anode thickness of 44 µm, except for a ~6-µm-thick separator-side surface layer. Here, the Li and Si concentrations are a factor 1.23 higher compared to the bulk for all SoC, indicating preferential Li binding to SiO x . These insights are so far not accessible with conventional analysis methods and are a first important step towards in-depth knowledge of quantitative Li distributions on the component level and a further application of IBA in the battery community.

These batteries aim to increase the range of electric vehicles by facilitating a lithium metal anode but are limited by operational temperatures above 60 °C. The feasibility of a cold start procedure is examined, which would enable a solid polymer battery to be used, without preconditioning, in a wide variety of ambient temperatures. The proposed solution involves dividing the solid-state battery into smaller sub-packs, which can be heated and brought online more quickly. Thermal modelling shows a cold start procedure is theoretically feasible when using a small liquid electrolyte lithium battery at the start. The key bottlenecks are the rate at which the solid-state batteries can be heated, and the discharge rates they can provide. After resistive heating is used for the first solid-state module, all subsequent heating can be provided by waste heat from the motor and operating battery modules. Due to the insulation required, the proposed system has lower volumetric, but higher gravimetric energy density than liquid electrolyte systems. This work suggests that with suitable system-level design, solid-state batteries could be widely adopted despite temperature constraints. Full article"

Ethylene diamine (EDA) and α-cyclodextrin (CD) were used to functionalize the surface of the graphene oxide layers. The oxygen reduction and surface modification occurred in-situ during the hydrothermal self-assembly process. The chemical functionality and structure of the resulting ethylene diamine modified (rGO-EDA) and cyclodextrin modified (rGO-CD) aerogels as well as of the pristine unmodified rGO aerogel were studied using XPS, SEM, XRD, and SANS techniques. The overall surface composition showed a significant decrease in the oxygen content for all synthesized aerogels. The surface modified aerogels were characterized by a disordered stacking of the assembled rGO layers. The surface functionalities resulted in a broad distribution of the interlayer spacing and introduced structural heterogeneities. Such disordered structures can enable a better adsorption mechanism of the sodium ions. Coin cells based on the synthesized aerogels and sodium metal were assembled and tested at several charge and discharge rates. The correlation between the surface functionality of the rGO, the induced structural heterogeneities due to the disordered stacking, and the electrochemical performance of sodium-ion batteries were investigated. Operando XRD measurements were carried out during the battery cycling to investigate the adsorption or intercalation nature of the sodiation mechanism. Full article"

This paper describes the methods used in the project SiCWell and a new approach to investigate the influence of these overlaid ripples on the battery in EVs. The ripple current generated by the main inverter is demonstrated with a measurement obtained from an electric vehicle. A simulation model is presented which is based on an artificial reference DC bus, according to ISO 21498-2, and uses driving cycles in order to obtain current profiles relevant for battery cycling. A prototype of a battery cycling tester capable of high frequency and precise ripple current generation was developed and is used to cycle cells with superimposed ripple currents within an aging study. To investigate the impact of the frequency and the amplitude of the currents on the battery’s lifetime, these ripple parameters are varied between different test series. Cell parameters such as impedance and capacity are regularly characterized and the aging of the cells is compared to standard DC cycled reference cells. The aging study includes a total of 60 automotive-sized pouch cells. The evaluation of ripple currents and their impact on the battery can improve the state-of-health diagnosis and remaining-useful life prognosis. For the development and validation of such methods, the cycled cells are monitored with a measurement system that regularly measures current and voltage with a sampling rate of 2 MHz. The resulting dataset is suitable for the design of future ripple current aging studies as well as for the development and validation of aging models and methods for battery diagnosis. Full article"

To further enhance the fundamental understanding of the electrode structure, we report on the use of multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy for the detailed characterization of layered cathode materials for Li-ion batteries (LiCoO 2, LiNi x Co 1−x O 2 , LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 ). Varying the laser excitation from the UV to the visible (257, 385, 515, 633 nm) reveals wavelength-dependent changes in the vibrational profile and overtone/combination bands, originating from resonance effects in LiCoO 2 . In mixed oxides, the influence of resonance effects on the vibrational profile is preserved but mitigated by the presence of Ni and/or Mn, highlighting the influence of resonance Raman spectroscopy on electronic structure changes. The use of UV laser excitation (257, 385 nm) is shown to lead to a higher scattering efficiency towards Ni in LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 compared to visible wavelengths, while deep UV excitation at 257 nm allows for the sensitive detection of surface species and/or precursor species reminiscent of the synthesis.

This study introduces an electrical equivalent circuit model of lithium-ion cells developed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Cell SoC, SoH, temperature, and C-rate are considered for more accurate cell impedance prediction, and the simulation results are verified with the measurement results.

The objective of this study is to measure the economic performance of the preferred business model by creating different scenarios comparing second life (spent) and new battery investment for seven different European regions and four energy management strategies. Findings reveal levels of economic ability for a total of 34 scenarios simulated, including direct savings per kWh, a total change in energy costs per year, battery charge/discharge cycles, and comparative breakeven analyses. Regional effects are also measured based on day-ahead electricity prices and solar irradiation. The minimum payback time is 7 years before battery system investment costs are covered. The most viable energy management strategies also had the highest number of charge/discharge cycles, which decreases battery lifetime. Investment in a second life battery compared to a new battery reduced the payback time by 0.5 to 2 years due to lower investment costs. However, the estimated lifetime range (3 to 10 years) is lower compared to a new battery (5 to 15 years), which questions the circular business model viability for the scenarios studied.

Specifically, components of electrolytes for LIBs should be adequately chosen from hundreds of thousands of candidate compounds. In this study, we aimed to evaluate some physical properties expected for combinations of molecules for electrolytes by microscopic simulations. That is, the viscosity, ionic conductivity, degree of dissociation, diffusion coefficient, and conformation of each molecule were analyzed via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We aimed to understand how molecular-sized structures and properties collaboratively affect the behavior of electrolytes. The practical models of molecules we used were ethylene carbonate (EC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), propylene carbonate (PC), butylene carbonate (BC), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), γ-valerolactone (GVL), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethyl-methyl carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6 ). Many molecular systems of electrolytes were simulated, in which one molar LiPF 6 was mixed into a single or combined solvent. It was found that small solvent molecules diffused with relative ease, and they contributed to the higher ionic conductivity of electrolytes. It was clarified that the diffusion coefficient of lithium (Li) ions is greatly affected by the surrounding solvent molecules. We can conclude that high-permittivity solvents can be selectively coordinated around Li ions, and Li salts are sufficiently dissociated, even when there is only a small content of high-permittivity solvent. Thus, we can confirm solely by MD simulation that one of the better candidates for solvent molecules, formamide (F), will exhibit higher performance than the current solvents. Full article"
A Method for Detecting the Existence of an Over-Discharged Cell in a Lithium-Ion Battery Pack via Measuring Total Harmonic Distortion,"Jonghyeon Kim, Julia Kowal",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8030026,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/3/26/pdf?version=1647851633,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/3/26,6,"This paper deals with a method to detect the existence of an over-discharged cell in a lithium-ion battery (LIB) pack by measuring the total harmonic distortion (THD) rate in the voltage response. Over-discharge of the LIB cell reduces the available capacity by irreversible chemical reactions, resulting in serious safety risks such as explosions. Even if only one over-discharged cell exists in the battery pack, it accelerates the decomposition of other cells. In general, the measurement of each cell voltage in a battery pack is required to detect one over-discharged cell. This is because if only the voltage of the battery pack is measured, it cannot be distinguished whether the voltage of each cell is uniformly low or one specific weak cell is over-discharged. The proposed method measures the frequency response through the voltage at only two terminals of the battery pack to detect the presence of one over-discharged cell. When the battery cell is discharged beyond a certain level, the system nonlinearity of the battery pack increases, and it can be detected from the increased THD rate of the battery pack. The proposed method is verified by simulation and measurement. Full article"

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an accepted method used to improve understanding around the chemical processes at the electrode surfaces. Nevertheless, its application is limited because the surfaces under investigation are mostly rough and inhomogeneous. Local elemental analysis, such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), could assist XPS to gain more insight into the chemical processes at the surfaces. In this paper, some challenges in using electron spectroscopy are discussed, such as binding energy (BE) referencing for the quantitative study of chemical shifts, gas atmospheric influences, or beam damage (including both AE and XP spectroscopy). Carefully prepared and surface-modified metallic lithium material is used as model surface, considering that Li is the key element for most battery applications. Full article"
Stationary Battery Thermal Management: Analysis of Active Cooling Designs,"Getu Hailu, Martin Henke, Todd Petersen",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8030023,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/3/23/pdf?version=1646202943,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/3/23,19,"Stationary battery systems are becoming more prevalent around the world, with both the quantity and capacity of installations growing at the same time. Large battery installations and uninterruptible power supply can generate a significant amount of heat during operation; while this is widely understood, current thermal management methods have not kept up with the increase of stationary battery installations. Active cooling has long been the default approach of thermal management for stationary batteries; however, there is no academic research or comparative studies available for this technology. The present work presents assessment of different active cooling methods through an experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics simulation. Following model validation, several cooling system configurations were analyzed, including effects from implementing either a perforated vent plate or vortex generators. The vent plate was observed to greatly increase cooling performance while simultaneously promoting temperature uniformity between batteries. Vortex generators were shown to marginally increase cooling performance, yet, future research is recommended to study the effects and improvement of the design. The average battery temperature for the vented model is reduced by approximately 5.2 °C, while the average temperature differential among the batteries was only 2.7 °C, less than the recommend value (3 °C) by ASHRAE/IEEE Standards.

Previously designed two-layered porosity-graded graphite anodes, together with Li x x Ni 0.6 0.6 Mn 0.2 0.2 Co 0.2 0.2 O 2 2 cathodes, were analysed in small pouch-cells with a capacity of around 1 Ah. For comparison, custom-made reference cells with the average properties of two-layered anodes were tested. Ten cells of each type were examined in total. Each cell pair, consisting of one double-layer and one single-layer (reference) cell, underwent the same test procedure. Besides regular charge and discharge cycles, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, incremental capacity analysis, differential voltage analysis and current-pulse measurement are used to identify the differences in ageing behaviour between the two cell types. The results show similar behaviour and properties at beginning-of-life, but an astonishing improvement in capacity retention for the double-layer cells regardless of the cycling conditions. Additionally, the lifetime of the single-layer cells was strongly influenced by the cycling conditions, and the double-layer cells showed less difference in ageing behaviour. Full article"

Because one of the important components that determines the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries is the electrode, the manufacturing process for this junction plays an important role in the entire production process. In particular, the process related to the resistance spot welding of the electrode is very important, directly affecting the safety of users, and greatly affecting the performance of the batteries. However, because the electrode tab is spot-welded onto the inner surface of the case, it is impossible to verify with visual testing (using the naked eye) whether the junction is well bonded. Therefore, it is very important to perform quality evaluation of the resistance welding of electrodes after completing the manufacturing process, using non-destructive testing methods. In this paper, a non-destructive ultrasonic testing technique was applied to examine the quality of lithium-ion batteries in which the negative electrode tabs were welded to the inner surface of the cell cans. The status of resistance spot welding between the electrode and the can was verified using deep-learning techniques with the experimentally acquired ultrasonic signal database. Full article"

Computer modelling was carried out to determine the dominant intrinsic defects, Li and Na ion diffusion pathways and promising dopants for experimental verification. The results show that the lowest energy intrinsic defect is the V–Si anti-site in both LiVSi 2 O 6 and NaVSi 2 O 6 . Li or Na ion migration is slow, with activation energies of 3.31 eV and 3.95 eV, respectively, indicating the necessity of tailoring these materials before application. Here, we suggest that Al on the Si site can increase the amount of Li and Na in LiVSi 2 O 6 and NaVSi 2 O 6 , respectively. This strategy can also be applied to create oxygen vacancies in both materials. The most favourable isovalent dopants on the V and Si sites are Ga and Ge, respectively. Full article"

To eliminate the need for additional hardware components, a software based prediction model is needed to track the temperature behavior. This study looks at machine learning algorithms that learn physical behavior of non-linear systems based on sample data. Here, it is shown how to improve the prediction accuracy using a new method called “artificial feature extraction” compared to classical time series approaches. We show its effectiveness on tracking the temperature behavior of a Li-ion cell with limited training data at one defined ambient temperature. A custom measuring system was created capable of tracking the cell temperature, by installing a temperature sensor into the cell wrap instead of attaching it to the cell housing. Additionally, a custom early stopping algorithm was developed to eliminate the need for further hyperparameters. This study manifests that artificially training sub models that extract features with high accuracy aids models in predicting more complex physical behavior. On average, the prediction accuracy has been improved by Error parsing MathML: error on line 1 at column 163: Entity 'nbsp' not defined Error parsing MathML: error on line 1 at column 163: Entity 'nbsp' not defined for the training data and by Error parsing MathML: error on line 1 at column 164: Entity 'nbsp' not defined Error parsing MathML: error on line 1 at column 164: Entity 'nbsp' not defined for the validation data compared to the base model.

Method for In-Operando Contamination of Lithium Ion Batteries for Prediction of Impurity-Induced Non-Obvious Cell Damage,"Patrick Höschele, Simon Franz Heindl, Bernd Schneider, Wolfgang Sinz, Christian Ellersdorfer",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8040035,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/4/35/pdf?version=1649928592,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/4/35,6,"The safety of lithium-ion batteries within electrified vehicles plays an important role. Hazards can arise from contaminated batteries resulting from non-obvious damages or insufficient production processes. A systematic examination requires experimental methods to provoke a defined contamination. Two prerequisites were required: First, the extent and type of contamination should be determinable to exclude randomness. Second, specimens should work properly before the contamination, enabling realistic behavior. In this study, two experimental methods were developed to allow for the first time a controlled and reproducible application of water or oxygen into 11 single-layer full cells (Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 /LiCoO 2 ) used as specimens during electrical cycling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to continuously monitor the specimens and to fit the parameters of an equivalent circuit model (ECM). For the first time, these parameters were used to calibrate a machine-learning algorithm which was able to predict the contamination state. A decision tree was calibrated with the ECM parameters of eight specimens (training data) and was validated by predicting the contamination state of the three remaining specimens (test data). The prediction quality proved the usability of classification algorithms to monitor for contaminations or non-obvious battery damage after manufacturing and during use. It can be an integral part of battery management systems that increases vehicle safety. Full article"
Comparison of Model-Based and Sensor-Based Detection of Thermal Runaway in Li-Ion Battery Modules for Automotive Application,"Jacob Klink, André Hebenbrock, Jens Grabow, Nury Orazov, Ulf Nylén, Ralf Benger, Hans-Peter Beck",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8040034,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/4/34/pdf?version=1649758532,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/4/34,40,"In recent years, research on lithium–ion (Li-ion) battery safety and fault detection has become an important topic, providing a broad range of methods for evaluating the cell state based on voltage and temperature measurements. However, other measurement quantities and close-to-application test setups have only been sparsely considered, and there has been no comparison in between methods. In this work, the feasibility of a multi-sensor setup for the detection of Thermal Runaway failure of automotive-size Li-ion battery modules have been investigated in comparison to a model-based approach. For experimental validation, Thermal Runaway tests were conducted in a close-to-application configuration of module and battery case—triggered by external heating with two different heating rates. By two repetitions of each experiment, a high accordance of characteristics and results has been achieved and the signal feasibility for fault detection has been discussed. The model-based method, that had previously been published, recognised the thermal fault in the fastest way—significantly prior to the required 5 min pre-warning time. This requirement was also achieved with smoke and gas sensors in most test runs. Additional criteria for evaluating detection approaches besides detection time have been discussed to provide a good starting point for choosing a suitable approach that is dependent on application defined requirements, e.g., acceptable complexity.

Therefore, the cells are modulated by switching varying the duty cycle, the current and the frequency up to the kHz-range. This is only beneficial if the switching does not lead to a significant additional aging. The scientific gap to assess and understand the impact of switching is investigated in this paper by testing 22 high-power 18650 lithium-ion cells (Samsung 25R). The cells are tested at 50 Hz and 10 kHz switching frequency during charge, discharge and charge/discharge at 50% duty cycle. The tests are compared to eight reference tests with continuous current flow performed at the average and the maximum current for charge and discharge, respectively. The results are obtained by evaluating the remaining capacity, resistance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and dV/dQ analysis. Before reaching rollover, the investigated cells lose homogeneity and cathode capacity but no significant difference for the aging parameters are found. After rollover, the cell-to-cell variation is greater than the aging induced by the different cycling parameters. Full article"
Optimized Nail for Penetration Test on Lithium-Ion Cells and Its Utilization for the Validation of a Multilayer Electro-Thermal Model,"Luigi Aiello, Gregor Gstrein, Simon Erker, Bernhard Kaltenegger, Christian Ellersdorfer, Wolfgang Sinz",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8040032,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/4/32/pdf?version=1648792676,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/4/32,15,"Nail penetration is one of the most critical scenarios for a lithium-ion cell: it involves the superposition of electrical, thermal and mechanical abusive loads. When an electrically conductive nail is introduced into the active layers of a lithium-ion cell, an electric short circuit takes place between the conductive components (electrodes and current collectors). Hence, for this load case, electro-thermal modeling must be performed considering each and every layer of the cell in order to predict the electric quantities and the cell temperature (with numerical models). When standard conic nails are used, as is typical for this class of tests, the electrical contact between conductive components and the nail itself suffers of poor reproducibility mainly due to the separator that interposes between the electrically conductive components. This phenomenon makes it difficult to validate electro-thermal models, since the electrical contact between nail and lithium-ion cell parts cannot be safely determined. In this work, an alternative nail with an optimized ratio between the external surface and volume is presented to overcome this issue. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed nail, five tests (with the same conditions) were conducted on five commercial lithium-ion pouch cells, monitoring the tabs voltage and surface temperature. In all tests, thermal runaway was reached within 30 s and the tabs voltage showed comparable behavior, indicating that the short circuit values for all five repetitions were similar. The investigation included the implementation of a detailed layers model to demonstrate how the validation of such model would be possible with the novel data. Full article"

The main reasons for their implementation are that they consume less or do not consume fossil fuel (no carbon dioxide pollution) and do not cause sound pollution. However, this technology has some challenges, including complex and troublesome accurate state of health estimation, which is affected by different factors. According to the increase in electric and hybrid vehicles’ application, it is crucial to have a more accurate and reliable estimation of state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) in different environmental conditions. This allows improving battery management system operation for optimal utilization of a battery pack in various operating conditions. This article proposes an approach to estimate battery capacity based on two parameters. First, a practical and straightforward method is introduced to assess the battery’s internal resistance, which is directly related to the battery’s remaining useful life. Second, the different least square algorithm is explored. Finally, a promising, practical, simple, accurate, and reliable technique is proposed to estimate battery capacity appropriately. The root mean square percentage error and the mean absolute percentage error of the proposed methods were calculated and were less than 0.02%. It was concluded the geometry method has all the advantages of a recursive manner, including a fading memory, a close form of a solution, and being applicable in embedded systems. Full article"

In this contribution, an advanced electrode equivalent circuit model is used in order to simulate fast-charging strategies without lithium-plating. A novel parameterization approach based on 3-electrode cell measurements is developed, which enables precise simulation fidelity. An optimized fast-charging strategy without evoking lithium-plating was simulated that lasted about 29 min for a 0–80% state of charge. This variable current strategy was compared in experiments to a conventional constant-current–constant-voltage fast-charging strategy that lasted 20 min. The experiments showed that the optimized strategy prevented lithium-plating and led to a 2% capacity fade every 100 fast-charging cycles. In contrast, the conventional strategy led to lithium-plating, about 20% capacity fade after 100 fast-charging cycles and the fast-charging duration extended from 20 min to over 30 min due to increased cell resistances. The duration of the optimized fast charging was constant at 29 min, even after 300 cycles. The developed methods are suitable to be applied for any given lithium-ion battery configuration in order to determine the maximum fast-charging capability while ensuring safe and durable cycling conditions.

In order to ensure the safety of LIBs, it is necessary to accurately estimate of the state of health (SOH) of the LIBs. This paper proposes a SOH hybrid estimation method based on incremental capacity (IC) curve and back-propagation neural network (BPNN). The voltage and current data of the LIB during the constant current (CC) charging process are used to convert into IC curves. Taking into account the incompleteness of the actual charging process, this paper divides the IC curve into multiple voltage segments for SOH prediction. Corresponding BP neural network is established in multiple voltage segments. The experiment divides the LIBs into five groups to carry out the aging experiment under different discharge conditions. Aging experiment data are used to establish the non-linear relationship between the decline of SOH and the change of IC curve by BP neural network. Experimental results show that in all voltage segments, the maximum mean absolute error does not exceed 2%. The SOH estimation method proposed in this research makes it possible to embed the SOH estimation function in battery management system (BMS), and can realize high-precision SOH online estimation.

Furthermore, the influence of pretreating the biowaste samples by hydrothermal carbonization and acid hydrolysis was also studied. Except for the olive mill solid waste, discharge capacities typical of biowaste-derived hard carbons were obtained in every case (≈300 mAh·g −1 at C/15). Furthermore, it seems that hydrothermal carbonization could improve the discharge capacity of biowaste samples derived from different nature at high cycling rates, which are the closest conditions to real applications.

The development of a numerical model for an explicit dynamic simulation of a Li-ion battery pack under impact implies a significant computational effort if detailed models of a single battery cell are employed. The present paper presents a homogenized finite element model of a battery cell, validated by experimental tests of individual materials and an impact test of an entire cell. The macro model is composed of shell elements representing outside casing and elements with a homogenized and isotropic material for the jelly roll. The displacements and deformed shape of the numerical model of the battery cell were compared with those measured on real test specimens; full-field optical scanning was employed to reconstruct the 3D shape of the deformed battery. The overall deformation of the simulation and experimental results are comparable with a deviation of the maximum intrusion of 14.8% for impact direction and 19.5% for the perpendicular direction considering the cumulative effects of simplifying hypotheses of the numerical model and experimental side effects. The results are a starting point for future analyses of a battery pack and its protection systems under impact. The model presented in this paper, considering the low computing power needed for calculation and acceptable mesh size for crash, should be able to be used in bigger resources consuming crash simulation models. In this way, the cells’ deformation and behavior can be tracked more easily for safety management and diagnosis of the crashworthiness of the packs or car batteries. Full article"

Therefore, a novel approach is presented in this study, which can predict the minimum terminal voltage for consumers. This consists of diagnostics of the wiring harness and of the lead-acid battery as well as predefined consumer currents. Using simulation, first the beginning of a drive cycle is simulated to determine the state of the powernet, and afterwards a critical driving maneuver is simulated to validate the predicted minimum terminal voltage. It demonstrates that the novel approach is able to predict a fault due to undervoltage.

A further way to improve the volumetric energy density is the usage of other materials with higher specific capacity, such as silicon instead of graphite as the active material for anodes. In this study, both opportunities, calendering and using silicon-containing composites, are combined to investigate the relations between material, process and performance. The applied line loads for the compaction are correlated with the silicon mass fraction and lead to a silicon-dependent mathematical model to estimate further line loads for silicon-graphite-composite electrodes. On the basis of established analyzing methods for adhesion strength and deformation behavior, it is shown that with increasing silicon content, the elastic deformation of the electrode coating rises. In addition, the overall porosity of the electrodes is less affected by silicon than the pore size distribution compared to graphite electrodes. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity decreases at higher silicon contents independent of coating density. Moreover, the long-term electrochemical stability deteriorates with increasing silicon content and coating density. Full article"

However, the escaping of polysulfide intermediates (produced during the redox reaction process) from the cathode structure is the primary reason for rapid capacity fading. Suppressing the polysulfide shuttle (PSS) is a viable solution for this technology to move closer to commercialization and supersede the established LIB technology. In this review, we have analyzed the challenges faced by LSBs and outlined current methods and materials used to address these problems. We conclude that in order to further pioneer LSBs, it is necessary to address these essential features of the sulfur cathode: superior electrical conductivity to ensure faster redox reaction kinetics and high discharge capacity, high pore volume of the cathode host to maximize sulfur loading/utilization, and polar PSS-resistive materials to anchor and suppress the migration of polysulfides, which can be developed with the use of nanofabrication and combinations of the PSS-suppressive qualities of each component. With these factors addressed, our world will be able to forge ahead with the development of LSBs on a larger scale—for the efficiency of energy systems in technology advancement and potential benefits to outweigh the costs and performance decay.

Herein, we report the effect of heat treatment conditions on the structure, composition, morphology, and electrochemical properties of α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers as an anode for lithium-ion batteries. The α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers were synthesized via electrospinning and post-annealing with differences in their annealing temperature of 300, 500, and 700 °C to produce FO300, FO500, and FO700 nanofibers, respectively. Improved electrochemical performance with a high reversible specific capacity of 599.6 mAh g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 was achieved after 50 cycles for FO700. The in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies conducted during the charge/discharge process revealed that the charge transfer and Li-ion diffusion behaviors were related to the crystallinity and structure of the as-synthesized α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers. The surfaces of the α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers were converted into Fe metal during the charging/discharging process, which resulted in improved electrical conductivity. The electron lifetime, as determined by the time constant of charge transfer, revealed that, when a conversion reaction occurred, the electrons tended to travel through the iron metal in the α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers. The role of iron as a pseudo-resistor with negligible capacitance was revealed by charge transfer resistance analysis. Full article"

As the main result of our analysis, we observe that unavoidable errors occurring in the initialization phase of the qubit, which can be detrimental for quantum computing applications, only marginally affect energy transfer and storage. This can lead counter-intuitively to improvements of the performances. This is a strong indication of the fact that IBM quantum devices are already in the proper range of parameters to be considered as good and stable quantum batteries comparable to state-of-the-art devices recently discussed in the literature.

Detection of Critical Conditions in Pouch Cells Based on Their Expansion Behavior,"Pascal Vorwerk, Sarah-Katharina Hahn, Christian Daniel, Ulrich Krause, Karola Keutel",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8050042,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/5/42/pdf?version=1652327959,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/5/42,8,"The present work examines 75 Ah nickel–cobalt–manganese (NMC)/graphite-based pouch cells with respect to their expansion behavior. The focus is on cell expansion due to critical cells according to the installation conditions of a battery module. Strain gauges were used for monitoring. By comparing the cell expansion in standard conditioning to that in an abuse (overcharging), information can be acquired about the suitability of the expansion behavior for early detection of critical cell states and to avoid resulting damage, e.g., cell opening or cell fire. The sequence of critical cell events has been shown to be easily reproducible; especially the first significant cell expansion due to internal gas formation, which was a reliable detection criterion for critical cell states.

An Experimental Investigation of Thermal Runaway and Gas Release of NMC Lithium-Ion Pouch Batteries Depending on the State of Charge Level,"Kofi Owusu Ansah Amano, Sarah-K. Hahn, Rico Tschirschwitz, Tim Rappsilber, Ulrich Krause",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8050041,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/5/41/pdf?version=1652261804,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/5/41,24,"In this study, 19 experiments were conducted with 25 pouch cells of NMC cathode to investigate thermal runaway and the release of gases from lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Single cells, double cells, and a four-cell battery stack were forced to undergo thermal runaway inside an air-tight reactor vessel with a volume of 100 dm 3 . The study involved two series of tests with two types of ignition sources. In the Series 1 tests, a heating plug was used to initiate thermal runaway in LIBs in the ranges of 80–89% and 90–100% SOC. In the Series 2 tests, a heating plate was used to trigger thermal runaway in LIBs in the ranges of 30–50%, 80–89%, and 90–100% SOC. Thermal runaway started at an onset temperature of 344 ± 5 K and 345 K for the Series 1 tests and from 393 ± 36 K to 487 ± 10 K for the Series 2 tests. Peak reaction temperatures ranged between 642 K and 1184 K, while the maximum pressures observed were between 1.2 bar and 7.28 bar. Thermal runaway induced explosion of the cells and lead to a rate of temperature increase greater than 10 K/s. The amounts of gases released from the LIBs were calculated from pressures and temperatures measured in the reactor. Then, the gas composition was analyzed using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The highest gaseous production was achieved at a range of 90–100% SOC and higher battery capacities 72 L L , 1.8 L / Ah L / Ah (Series 1, battery stack) and 103 L L , 3.2 L / Ah L / Ah (Series 2, 32 Ah cell)). Among the gases analyzed, the concentration of gaseous emissions such as C 2 H 4 , CH 4 , and C 2 H 6 increased at a higher cell capacity in both series of tests. The study results revealed characteristic variations of thermal behavior with respect to the type of ignition source used. Full article"
Identifying Anode and Cathode Contributions in Li-Ion Full-Cell Impedance Spectra,"Marco Heinrich, Nicolas Wolff, Steffen Seitz, Ulrike Krewer",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8050040,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/5/40/pdf?version=1651062875,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/5/40,3,"Measured impedance spectra of Li-ion battery cells are often reproduced with equivalent circuits or physical models to determine losses due to charge transfer processes at the electrodes. The identified model parameters can usually not readily or unambiguously be assigned to the anode and the cathode. A new measurement method is presented that enables the assignment of features of impedance spectra of full cells to single electrodes. To this end, temperature gradients are imprinted perpendicular to the electrode layers of a single-layered Li-ion battery cell while impedance spectra are measured. The method exploits different dependences of the charge transfer processes at the electrodes on temperature. An equivalent circuit model of RC-elements and the effect of temperature on the related electrode properties is discussed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. A reliable assignment of the change of impedance spectra to the electrode processes is shown to be possible. The assignment can be used to identify if changes in an impedance spectrum originate from the anode or the cathode. Full article"

The model is based on Verhulst’s logistic equations and distributions in order to describe incremental capacity peaks. The model performance is compared with polynomial models and is demonstrated on a commercial lithium-ion cell. Experimental data features low-current discharges performed at temperatures ranging from −20 °C to 55 °C. The results demonstrate several advantages of the model compared to empirical models. The proposed model enables a clear description of the geometric features of incremental capacity peaks. It also doubles as an open circuit voltage model as the voltage curve can be fully recovered from parameterization on incremental capacity curves. The study of temperature sensitivity show that peak geometric parameters can be modelled as a function of temperature. An example of practical application is then displayed by using the model to estimate battery state-of-charge from voltage and temperature measurements. This example can expand to other practical applications for battery management systems such as state-of-health monitoring. Full article

Due to the fact that energy storage systems (ESS) penetrate within many applications, the availability of their accurate and simple simulation models for time–domain analysis is very desirable. This paper describes the configuration of the laboratory measuring systems required for data acquisition, curation, and analysis of received measured data required for development of equivalent electrical circuit models (EECM) of electrochemical cells. Nowadays, various types of electrochemical cells are available for packaging technology. Therefore, the evaluation of presented identification methodology is validated through measurements of two different types of LiFePO 4 cells. The first cell type is prismatic labeled LFP040AHA, and the second type is NPB 60 AH of the same manufacturer. The main aim of this paper is the determination of the elements of equivalent electrical circuit schematics of selected electrochemical cells. Consequently, the development of a simulation model is described, together with the evaluation of its accuracy through comparisons with experimental measurements. From achieved results, the relative error of simulation model varies at 2%, and thus the presented methodology is suitable for identification of EECM, and consequent design of accurate and fast computing simulation models of ESS systems.

Composite electrodes based on carbon microstructures are often used as a host for sulfur. However, sulfur lixiviation, insoluble species formation, and how to maximize the sulfur-carbon contact in looking for improved electrochemical performance are still major challenges. In this study, a nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon is used as a host for sulfur. The S/C composite electrodes are prepared by sulfur melting-diffusion process at 155 °C. The effect of the sulfur melting-diffusion time [sulfur infiltration time] (1–24 h) and sulfur content (10–70%) is investigated by using XRD, SEM, TEM and TGA analyses and correlated with the electrochemical performance in Li-S cells. S/C composite electrode with homogeneous sulfur distribution can be reached with 6 h of sulfur melting-diffusion and 10 wt.% of sulfur content. Li-S cell with this composite shows a high use of sulfur and sufficient electronic conductivity achieving an initial discharge capacity of 983 mA h g −1 and Coulombic efficiency of 99% after 100 cycles.

The graphite anode with large volume variation during the charge/discharge process showed poor cycle life performance, while hard carbon and soft carbon with low-volume expansion showed good cycle life. The SF hard carbon electrodes with a high loading of 10.7 mg/cm 2 revealed good long-term cycling performance similar to conventional slurry-casting (CSC) electrodes. It demonstrated nearly 90% capacity retention after 120 cycles under a current of 1/3 C with LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 (NCM523) as cathode in coin cell. The rate capability of the high-loading SF electrodes also is comparable to the CSC electrodes. The high stability of SF hard carbon and soft carbon anodes was attributed to its low-volume variation, which could maintain their integrity even though PTFE was defluorinated to amorphous carbon irreversibly. However, the reduced amorphous carbon cannot tolerate huge volume variation of graphite during cycling, resulting in poor stability. Full article"
Metal Substitution versus Oxygen-Storage Modifier to Regulate the Oxygen Redox Reactions in Sodium-Deficient Three-Layered Oxides,"Mariya Kalapsazova, Rositsa Kukeva, Ekaterina Zhecheva, Radostina Stoyanova",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8060056,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/56/pdf?version=1655431206,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/56,7,"Sodium-deficient nickel-manganese oxides with three-layered stacking exhibit the unique property of dual nickel-oxygen redox activity, which allows them to achieve enormous specific capacity. The challenge is how to stabilize the oxygen redox activity during cycling. This study demonstrates that oxygen redox activity of P 3-Na 2/3 Ni 1/2 Mn 1/2 O 2 during both Na + and Li + intercalation can be regulated by the design of oxide architecture that includes target metal substituents (such as Mg 2+ and Ti 4+ ) and oxygen storage modifiers (such as CeO 2 ). Although the substitution for nickel with Ti 4+ amplifies the oxygen redox activity and intensifies the interaction of oxides with NaPF 6 - and LiPF 6 -based electrolytes, the Mg 2+ substituents influence mainly the nickel redox activity and suppress the deposition of electrolyte decomposed products (such as MnF 2 ). The CeO 2 -modifier has a much stronger effect on the oxygen redox activity than that of metal substituents; thus, the highest specific capacity is attained. In addition, the CeO 2 -modifier tunes the electrode–electrode interaction by eliminating the deposition of MnF 2 . As a result, the Mg-substituted oxide modified with CeO 2 displays high capacity, excellent cycling stability and exceptional rate capability when used as cathode in Na-ion cell, while in Li-ion cell, the best performance is achieved for Ti-substituted oxide modified by CeO 2 .

Regarding this so-called structural battery, composites enable the storage of electrical energy in commonly used load bearing fibre composite structures. A structural battery composite can store electrical energy while bearing mechanical loads, thus reducing parasitic mass and volume. In this study, structural cathodes were prepared by slurry coating carbon fibres with lithium iron phosphate (LFP), polyethylene oxide (PEO), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and carbon black. For the structural anodes, the carbon fibres were utilised as active material and slurry coated with PEO and LiTFSI. These structural electrodes as well as a structural separator were characterised by electrochemical cycling. With 139 mAh g − 1 AM mAh g AM − 1 , the structural cathodes demonstrated good utilisation of the active material. The carbon fibres used in the anode exhibited capacities of up to 92 mAh g − 1 AM mAh g AM − 1 . High irreversible lithium losses were observed, which are attributed to the poor electrolyte wetting behaviour of the carbon fibres. A structural battery demonstrator with a lithium metal anode was realised and reached a maximum specific energy of 64 Wh kg − 1 Wh kg − 1 with respect to electrode and separator weight. Full article"
Water-Soluble Conductive Composite Binder for High-Performance Silicon Anode in Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Zikai Li, Anru Guo, Dong Liu",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8060054,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/54/pdf?version=1654667953,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/54,21,"The design of novel and high-performance binder systems is an efficient strategy to resolve the issues caused by huge volume changes of high-capacity anodes. Herein, we develop a novel water-soluble bifunctional binder composed of a conductive polythiophene polymer (PED) and high-adhesive polyacrylic acid (PAA) with abundant polar groups. Compared with conventional conductive additives, the flexible conductive polymer can solve the insufficient electrical contact between active materials and the conductive agent, thus providing the integral conductive network, which is extremely important for stable electrochemical performance. Additionally, the polar groups of this composite binder can form double H-bond interactions with the hydroxyl groups of SiO 2 layers onto the silicon surface, keeping an integral electrode structure, which can decrease the continuous formation of SEI films during the repeated cycles. Benefiting from these bifunctional advantages, the Si electrodes with the composite binder delivered a high reversible capacity of 2341 mAh g −1 at 1260 mA g −1 , good cycle stability with 88.8% retention of the initial reversible capacity over 100 cycles, and high-rate capacity (1150 mAh g −1 at 4200 mA g −1 ).

A Switch-Reduced Multicell-to-Multicell Battery Equalizer Based on Full-Bridge Bipolar-Resonant LC Converter,"Peng Xu, Longyun Kang, Di Xie, Xuan Luo, Hongye Lin",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8060053,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/53/pdf?version=1654256331,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/53,13,"Many battery equalizers have been proposed to achieve voltage consistency between series connected battery cells. Among them, the multicell-to-multicell (MC2MC) equalizers, which can directly transfer energy from consecutive more-charged cells to less-charged cells, can enable fast balancing and a high efficiency. However, due to the limitations of the equalizers, it is not possible to achieve fast equalization and reduce the size of the circuit at the same time. Therefore, a MC2MC equalizer based on a full-bridge bipolar-resonant LC Converter (FBBRLCC) is proposed in this paper, which not only implements MC2MC equalization, but also greatly reduces the circuit size by reducing the number of switches by nearly half. A mathematical model and simulation comparison with conventional equalizers are used to illustrate the high-speed equalization performance of the proposed equalizer and excellent balancing efficiency. An experimental prototype for eight cells is built to verify the performance of the proposed FBBRLCC equalizer and the balancing efficiencies in different operating modes are from 85.19% to 88.77% with the average power from 1.888 W to 14.227 W.

The as-prepared final product was then ball milled in a planetary mill with and without carbon black. The crystal structure and morphology of the samples were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical performance was studied in a galvanostatic mode in varied voltage intervals and at different cycling rates in combination with in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The resistance measured using in situ EIS had the highest values at the end of the discharge and the lowest when charging. The lithium diffusion coefficient, determined by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), in samples milled with and without carbon black was an order of magnitude higher than that for the pristine sample. It was shown that improved electrochemical performance of the carbon composite TiNb 2 O 7 /C (reversible capacity of 250 mAh g −1 at C/10 with Coulomb efficiency of ~99%) was associated with improved conductivity due to the formation of a conductive carbon matrix and uniform distribution of submicron particles by size.

Comparison of the Properties of Ni–Mn Hydroxides/Oxides with Ni–Mn Phosphates for the Purpose of Hybrid Supercapacitors,"Lyubomir Soserov, Delyana Marinova, Violeta Koleva, Antonia Stoyanova, Radostina Stoyanova",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8060051,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/51/pdf?version=1654137823,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/6/51,12,"This study aims to quantify the synergistic effect of Ni 2+ and Mn 2+ ions on the capacitive performance of oxide, hydroxide and phosphate electrodes in alkaline electrolytes. Three types of phases containing both nickel and manganese in a ratio of one-to-one were selected due to their stability in alkaline media: oxides with ilmenite and spinel structures (NiMnO 3 and Ni 1.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 ); hydroxides with layered structures (β-Ni 1/2 Mn 1/2 (OH) 2 ); and phosphates with olivine and maricite structures (LiNi 1/2 Mn 1/2 PO 4 and NaNi 1/2 Mn 1/2 PO 4 ). In the mixed hydroxides and phosphates, Ni 2+ and Mn 2+ ions randomly occupied one crystallographic site, whereas in the ilmenite oxide, a common face was shared by the Ni 2+ and Mn 4+ ions. The electrochemical parameters of the Ni–Mn compositions were evaluated in asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor cells working with alkaline electrolytes and activated carbon as a negative electrode. A comparative analysis of oxides, hydroxides and phosphates enabled us to differentiate the effects of nickel and manganese ions, structures and morphologies on their capacitive performance. Thus, the best performed electrode was predicted. The electrode composition should simultaneously contain Ni and Mn ions, and their morphologies should comprise spherical aggregates. This was an ilmenite NiMnO 3 , which delivers high energy and power density (i.e., 65 W h kg −1 at 3200 W kg −1 ) and exhibits a good cycling stability (i.e., around 96% after 5000 cycles at a current load of 240 mA g −1 ).

A two-term calibration workflow was used for accurate complex impedance measurements across a broad frequency range of 10 mHz to 2 kHz, resulting in calibrated resistance and reactance values. The EIS calibration significantly improved the measurements, particularly at high frequencies above 200 Hz, with differences of 6–8% to the uncalibrated impedance. With an electromagnetic finite element method (FEM) model, we showed that the impedance is strongly influenced by the cable fixturing and the self-inductance of the wire conductors due to alternating currents, which are efficiently removed by the proposed calibration workflow. For single cells, we measured the resistance and the reactance with respect to the state-of-charge (SoC) at different frequencies and a given rest period. For Ni-Cd blocks that include two cells in series, we found good agreement of EIS curves with single cells. As such, EIS can be used as a fast and reliable method to estimate the cell or block capacity status. For electrochemical interpretation, we used an equivalent electric circuit (EEC) model to fit the impedance spectra and to extract the main electrochemical parameters based on calibrated EIS, including charge-transfer kinetics, mass transport, and ohmic resistances. From the charge-transfer resistance, we computed the exchange current density, resulting in 0.23 A/cm 2 , reflecting high intrinsic rates of the redox electron transfer processes in Ni-Cd cells.

Full prelithiation of the anode was achieved by assembling a half cell with a 2 µm-sized Si anode (0 V vs. Li/Li + ) and Li metal. A three-electrode full cell (100% prelithiation) was assembled using an activated carbon (AC) cathode with a high specific surface area (3041 m 2 /g), fully prelithiated Si anode, and Li metal reference electrode. A three-electrode full cell (87% prelithiation) using a Si anode prelithiated with 87% Li ions was also assembled. Both cells displayed similar energy density levels at a lower power density (200 Wh/kg at ≤100 W/kg; based on the total mass of AC and Si). However, at a higher power density (1 kW/kg), the 100% prelithiation cell maintained a high energy density (180 Wh/kg), whereas that of the 87% prelithiation cell was significantly reduced (80 Wh/kg). During charge/discharge cycling at ~1 kW/kg, the energy density retention of the 100% prelithiation cell was higher than that of the 87% prelithiation cell. The larger irreversibility of the Si anode during the initial Li-ion uptake/release cycles confirmed that the simple full prelithiation process is essential for Si-based LIC cells. Full article"

This battery inherits the advantages of the low-cost anode while possessing the capability of the Li-ion cathode. One of the major challenges is to design a proper electrolyte to nourish such strengths and alleviate the downsides, because two different mechanisms are functioning separately at the node–electrolyte and the cathode–electrolyte interfaces. In this work, we design a non-Newtonian electrolyte which offers many advantages for a Zn/LiMn 2 O 4 battery. The corrosion is kept low while almost non-dendritic zinc deposition is confirmed by chronoamperometry and ex situ microscopy. The gel strength and gelling duration of such non-Newtonian electrolytes can be controlled. The ionic conductivity of such gels can reach 60 mS⋅cm −1 . The battery exhibits reduced self-discharge, 6–10% higher specific discharge capacity than the aqueous reference battery, high rate capability, nearly 80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, and about 100 mAh⋅g −1 of specific discharge capacity at cycle No. 1000th. Negligible amorphization on the cathode surface and no passivation on the anode surface are observed after 1000 cycles, evidenced by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy on the post-run battery electrodes.

To enhance the battery thermal management system, a comprehensive investigation of the thermal behaviour and heat exchange process of battery systems is paramount. In this paper, a three-dimensional electro-thermal model coupled with fluid dynamics module was developed to comprehensively analyze the temperature distribution of battery packs and the heat carried away. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results of the lumped battery model were validated and verified by considering natural ventilation speed and ambient temperature. In the artificial neural networks (ANN) model, the multilayer perceptron was applied to train the numerical outputs and optimal design of the battery setup, achieving a 1.9% decrease in maximum temperature and a 4.5% drop in temperature difference. The simulation results provide a practical compromise in optimizing the battery configuration and cooling efficiency, balancing the layout of the battery system, and safety performance. The present modelling framework demonstrates an innovative approach to utilizing high-fidelity electro-thermal/CFD numerical inputs for ANN optimization, potentially enhancing the state-of-art thermal management and reducing the risks of thermal runaway and fire outbreaks.

However, such materials possess several drawbacks including relatively low volumetric energy density caused by insufficient values of tap density. Herein, we demonstrate an exceptionally rapid and energy-saving synthesis of the mixed hydroxide precursor for the LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 (NMC811) positive electrode (cathode) material through a microwave-assisted hydrothermal technique. The obtained material further serves as a space-filler to fill the voids between spherical agglomerates in the cathode powder prepared via a conventional co-precipitation technique boosting the tap density of the resulting mixed NMC811 by 30% up to 2.9 g/cm 3 . Owing to increased tap density, the volumetric energy density of the composite cathode exceeds 2100 mWh/cm 3 vs. 1690 mWh/cm 3 for co-precipitated samples. The crystal structure of the obtained materials was scrutinized by powder X-ray diffraction and high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM); the cation composition and homogeneity of TM spatial distribution were investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in a STEM mode (STEM-EDX). Well-crystallized NMC811 with a relatively low degree of anti-site disorder and homogeneous TM distribution in a combination with the co-precipitated material delivers a reversible discharge capacity as high as ~200 mAh/g at 0.1C current density and capacity retention of 78% after 300 charge/discharge cycles (current density 1C) within the voltage region of 2.7–4.3 V vs. Li/Li + .

Each test cell either had a full set of plates or a reduced, negative-limited set of plates. With these test cells the predictability of the dynamic charge acceptance (DCA) by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is investigated. Thereby, the DCA was performed according to EN 50342-6:2015 standard. The micro cycling approach was used for the EIS measurements to disregard any influencing factors from previous usage. During the evaluation, Kramers-Kronig (K-K) was used to avoid systematic errors caused by violations of the stationarity, time-invariance or linearity. Furthermore, the analysis of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) was used to identify a usable equivalent circuit model (ECM) and starting values for the parameter prediction. For all cell types and layouts, the resistance R 1 , the parameter indicating the size of the first/high-frequency semicircle, is smaller for cells with higher DCA. According to the literature, this semicircle represents the charge transfer reaction, thus confirming that current-enhancing additives may decrease the pore diameter of the negative electrode.

Identification of Typical Sub-Health State of Traction Battery Based on a Data-Driven Approach,"Cheng Wang, Chengyang Yu, Weiwei Guo, Zhenpo Wang, Jiyuan Tan",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8070065,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/7/65/pdf?version=1656927078,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/7/65,5,"As the core component of an electric vehicle, the health of the traction battery closely affects the safety performance of the electric vehicle. If the sub-health state cannot be identified and dealt with in time, it may cause traction battery failure, pose a safety hazard, and cause property damage to the driver and passengers. This study used data-driven methods to identify the two typical types of sub-health state. For the first type of sub-health state, the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) method was used to determine whether there was an inconsistency between the voltage of a single battery and the overall voltage of the battery pack. In order to determine the threshold, the ICC value of each vehicle under different working conditions was analyzed using box plots, and a statistical ICC threshold of 0.805 was used as the standard to determine the first sub-health type. For the second type of sub-health state, the Z-score and the differential area method were combined to determine whether the single cell voltage deviated from the overall battery pack voltage. A battery whose voltage differential area exceeds the range of u ± 3σ is regarded as having a sub-health state. The results show that both methods can accurately judge the sub-health state type of a single battery. Furthermore, combined with the one-month operation data of the vehicle, we could calculate the sub-health state frequency of each single battery and take single batteries with a high frequency as the key object of attention in future vehicle operations.

Upgrading the Properties of Ceramic-Coated Separators for Lithium Secondary Batteries by Changing the Mixing Order of the Water-Based Ceramic Slurry Components,"Ssendagire Kennedy, Jeong-Tae Kim, Yong Min Lee, Isheunesu Phiri, Sun-Yul Ryou",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8070064,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/7/64/pdf?version=1656666953,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/7/64,9,"Developing uniform ceramic-coated separators in high-energy Li secondary batteries has been a challenging task because aqueous ceramic coating slurries have poor dispersion stability and coating quality on the hydrophobic surfaces of polyolefin separators. In this study, we develop a simple but effective strategy for improving the dispersion stability of aqueous ceramic coating slurries by changing the mixing order of the ceramic slurry components. The aqueous ceramic coating slurry comprises ceramics (Al 2 O 3 ), polymeric binders (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC), surfactants (disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, DLSS), and water. The interaction between the ceramic slurry components is studied by changing the mixing order of the ceramic slurry components and quantitatively evaluating the dispersion stability of the ceramic coating slurry using a Lumisizer. In the optimized mixing sequence, Al 2 O 3 and DLSS premixed in aqueous Al 2 O 3 -DLSS micelles through strong surface interactions, and they repel each other due to steric repulsion. The addition of CMC in this state does not compromise the dispersion stability of aqueous ceramic coating slurries and enables uniform ceramic coating on polyethylene (PE) separators. The prepared Al 2 O 3 ceramic-coated separators (Al 2 O 3 –CCSs) exhibit improved physical properties, such as high wettability electrolyte uptake and ionic conductivity, compared to the bare PE separators. Furthermore, Al 2 O 3 –CCSs exhibit improved electrochemical performance, such as rate capability and cycling performance. The half cells (LiMn 2 O 4 /Li metal) comprising Al 2 O 3 –CCSs retain 90.4% (88.4 mAh g −1 ) of initial discharge capacity after 150 cycles, while 27.6% (26.4 mAh g −1 ) for bare PE. Furthermore, the full cells (LiMn 2 O 4 /graphite) consisting of Al 2 O 3 –CCSs exhibit 69.8% (72.2 mAh g −1 ) of the initial discharge capacity and 24.9% (25.0 mAh g −1 ) for bare PE after 1150 cycles.

The effect of x (proportion of components Li 2 MnO 3 and LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 ) on the structural, morphological, and electrochemical performance of the material was evaluated. Materials were structurally characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the morphological analysis was performed using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique, while charge–discharge curves and differential capacity and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the electrochemical behavior. The results confirm the formation of the structures with two phases corresponding to the rhombohedral space group R3m and the monoclinic space group C2/m, which was associated to the components of the layered material. Very dense agglomerations of particles between 10 and 20 µm were also observed. In addition, the increase in the proportion of the LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.5 O 2 component affected the initial irreversible capacity and the Li 2 MnO 3 layer’s activation and cycling performance, suggesting an optimal chemical ratio of the material’s component layers to ensure high energy density and long-term durability.

LIBs are composed of a positive electrode, a negative electrode, an electrolyte, and a binder. Among them, electrolytes consist of organic solvents and lithium ion conducting salts. The electrolytes used in LIBs are mostly linear and cyclic alkyl carbonates. These electrolytes are usually based on their combinations to allow the use of Li as the anodic active component, resulting in the high power and energy density of batteries. However, these organic electrolytes have high volatility and flammability that pose a serious safety issue when exposed to extreme conditions such as elevated temperatures. At that time, these electrolytes can react with active electrode materials and release a considerable amount of heat and gas. In this study, a simultaneous thermal analysis-mass spectrometry analysis was performed on six different organic solvents to examine the effect of water on hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation temperature in the electrolyte of a LIB. The electrolytes used in the experiment were anhydrous diethyl carbonate, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, ethylene carbonate, 1,3-dioxolane, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran, each containing LiPF 6 . The HF formation temperature was observed and compared with that when water entered the electrolyte exposed to high-temperature conditions such as fire. Full article"

The internal temperature, which is complicated to measure with conventional temperature sensors, plays an important role here. For this reason, numerous methods exist in the literature for determining the internal cell temperature without sensors, which are usually based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This study presents a method in the time domain, based on the pulse resistance, for determining the internal cell temperature by examining the temperature behavior for the cylindrical formats 18650, 21700, and 26650 in isothermal and transient temperature states for different states of charge (SOCs). A previously validated component-resolved 2D thermal model was used to analyze the location of the calculated temperature T R T R within the cell, which is still an unsolved question for pulse resistance-based temperature determination. The model comparison shows that T R T R is close to the average jelly roll temperature. The differences between surface temperature and T R T R depend on the SOC and cell format and range from 2.14 2.14 K K to 2.70 2.70 K K (18650), 3.07 3.07 K K to 3.85 3.85 K K (21700), and 4.74 4.74 K K to 5.45 5.45 K K (26650). The difference decreases for each cell format with increasing SOC and is linear dependent on the cell diameter. Full article"

To determine the possibility of increasing the degree of graphitization of nanodispersed carbon forming shells around the silicon particles at lower temperatures, nickel in the form of an alcoholic solution of Ni(NO 3 ) 2 was introduced as a catalyst into the pellets of the resulting composite. The XRD, Raman scattering and EDS methods were used to investigate changes both in the phase and elemental composition of materials resulting from the annealing of the Ni-containing Si-C composite over the temperature range of 500–1100 °C. It was found for the first time that nickel silicides that emerged during the annealing became catalysts and, at the same time, intermediate products, of cubic silicon carbide (β-SiC) synthesis, which reduced its temperature formation from ~1100 °C to ~800 °C. The same compounds had a catalytic effect on the carbon atom association, leading to an increase in the degree of its graphitization. The influence of changing the composition of the investigated material on the electrochemical characteristics of the obtained negative LIB electrodes was traced. Full article"

By the proper processing of the filler (i.e., hydrophobization with octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and ultrasonic exfoliation) and its optimal loading (i.e., 10 wt%), composites with thermal conductivity up to 3.543 W·m −1 ·K −1 were obtained. Conductive heat flow (−280.04 W), measured in real heating–cooling conditions, proved to be superior to that of a commercial heatsink paste (−161.92 W), which has a much higher density (2.5 g/cm 3 compared to 1.05 g/cm 3 of these composites). The mechanical and electrical properties are also affected in a favorable way (increased modulus and elongation, low dielectric losses, and electrical conductivity) for applications as thermal management materials.

Testing a Lithium-Oxygen (Air) Battery: Catalytic Properties of Positive Electrode Materials,"Vera Bogdanovskaya, Oleg Korchagin",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8080094,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/94/pdf?version=1660719136,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/94,,"Although research in the field of lithium-oxygen (air) batteries (LOB) is rapidly developing, few comprehensive studies on the dependence of the catalytic properties of positive electrode materials on LOB test conditions are present. In this paper, the influence of the current density, the type of oxidizer (pure oxygen or air), and a solvent in the electrolyte (DMSO or tetraglyme) on the electrocatalytic properties of PtM/CNT systems (M = Ru, Co, Cr) used as a positive electrode is investigated. It is shown that at a current density of 500 mA/g, more pronounced catalytic effects are observed during the LOB operation than that at 200 mA/g. The obtained results may be explained by the reduced adverse impact of surface passivation with lithium peroxide in the presence of catalysts compared to a similar effect when using unmodified carbon nanotubes (CNT). It is established that the influence of the current density on the catalytic properties continues upon the transition from oxygen to air as an oxidizer. When studying the effect of electrolytes on the catalytic properties of materials subjected to long-term LOB cycling, it is shown that the catalytic effects are most prominent when charged in a tetraglyme medium. Although using a catalyst has practically no effect on the number of cycles for both electrolytes, LOB having tetraglyme exceeds the cyclability of LOB having DMSO. Full article"
A Novel Synchronized Multiple Output DC-DC Converter Based on Hybrid Flyback-Cuk Topologies,"Khaled A. Mahafzah, Mohammad A. Obeidat, Ali Q. Al-Shetwi, Taha Selim Ustun",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8080093,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/93/pdf?version=1660563180,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/93,22,"This paper proposes a new hybrid flyback-Cuk (HFC) converter. The new converter consists of a single switch, a single isolated input, and dual output based on flyback and Cuk topologies. The new HFC topology is proposed to reduce switching losses and improve the duty cycle range over which voltage can be stepped down, which would ultimately lead to an increase in efficiency. For step-down capability, the traditional single topologies (flyback or Cuk) require a less than 50% duty cycle. The low duty cycle of conventional converters leads to low operational efficiency. Therefore, the developed HFC can operate at a duty cycle of up to 85% for the same capability. The analysis, derivations, design, and simulation of the proposed HFC are thoroughly discussed for two different applications at two different power levels. The simulation results are obtained using MATLAB 2020a. The developed HFC’s efficiency as a function of the duty cycle is plotted, which reaches 89%, representing a significant efficiency improvement. The proposed converter can supply and absorb power simultaneously, giving it a significant edge over other converters. It is suitable for energy conversion and storage systems, such as renewable energy systems and electric vehicles (EV). To show the effectiveness and validate the new topology proposed, an EV along with battery energy storage (BES), is applied to charge (EV) and recharge (BES) simultaneously. The simulation results of 1.5 kW of HFC-PFC over the universal voltage range show that the proposed HFC can achieve a high power factor up to 97.5% at 260 V rms . Moreover, the total harmonics distortion is measured between 36.25 and 27.69%. Thus, the results can achieve all required functions efficiently with minimum losses at a high range of duty cycles.

The modification of battery component materials represent a common approach to improve battery performance. The effects of cell design on cell performance are seldom investigated. In this study, we designed four battery structures as follows. Cell 1: close-proximity electrode, Cell 2: equal-area electrode, Cell 3: large zinc electrode, and Cell 4: air channel flow. The effects of four factors: (1) carbon paste, (2) natural and forced air convection, (3) anode/cathode area ratio, and (4) anode–cathode distance were also investigated. Results showed that the addition of carbon paste on the air side of 25BC increased cell power density under forced air convection. Moreover, cell performance also improved by increasing the anode/cathode ratio and by decreasing the anode–cathode distance. These four types of cells were compared based on the oxygen reduction reaction electrode area. Cell 3 displayed the highest power density. In terms of volumetric power density, the proximity cell (Cell 1) exhibited the highest power density among the cells. Therefore, this cell configuration may be suitable for portable applications.

To adapt the model to higher-level applications, this paper proposes an improved FOM considering electrolyte-phase diffusion (FOMe) and then proposes a complete method for parameter identification based on three characteristic SOC intervals: the positive solid phase, negative solid phase, and electrolyte phase. The method mainly determines the above three characteristic intervals and identifies four thermodynamic parameters and five dynamic parameters. Furthermore, the paper describes a framework, which first verifies the model and parameter identification method separately based on pseudo two-dimensional model simulations, and secondly verifies FOMe and its parameters as a whole based on the experiments. The results, which are based on simulations and actual L i 0 . 8 C o 0 . 1 M n 0 . 1 O 2 L i 0 . 8 C o 0 . 1 M n 0 . 1 O 2 lithium-ion batteries under multiple typical operating profiles and comparisons with other parameter identification methods, show that the proposed model and parameter identification method is highly accurate and efficient.

Long-life and safe LMBs require the development of solid or semisolid (e.g., gel polymer) electrolytes capable of blocking lithium dendrites. In this context, Janus double-faced membranes (JMs) offer interesting perspectives, as they allow for modulating the properties of each side according to specific requests. In this paper, we report on facile fabrication via the solvent casting of JMs based on poly(vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP). Here, an electronically insulating layer containing Al 2 O 3 is in contact with the anode, whereas a mixed ionically–electronically conducting layer containing Al 2 O 3 , carbon nanotubes, and Super P carbon black is in contact with the cathode. We also investigate the role of the JM thickness and show that a 40 μm membrane allows for ~45% of the specific nominal capacity at 2C with Coulombic efficiency of ~100%. The proposed JMs are very promising for LMBs. Full article"

This electrochemical system features the hike on the charging curve plateau, which is interpreted as the change from I–V of the Ti-Si@O@Al contact. The latter is due to the change in the type of silicon conductivity during lithiation, as a result of which the ohmic metal-semiconductor contact proves to be biased in the reverse direction, and the charging current is maintained by minority charge carriers. It is shown that the current-conducting component Si@O@Al is formed by a solid solution a-Si(Al), which has a p-type conductivity. The change in the type of conductivity occurs as a result of silicon compensation through lithiation. It was found that Si@O@Al is nonlinear conductor, which can be considered as a percolation cluster formed by amorphous silicon nanoparticles and molecular clusters of silicon dioxide. The height of the Schottky barrier of the Ti|a-Si(Al) contact and the electron affinity of the a-Si(Al) solid solution were estimated. Full article"

A stack of 22 cells, each with 1500 cm 2 of nominal electrode area, was constructed and tested using constant current and constant power protocols. Typical ratios of charging to discharging power that prevail in various applications (e.g., peak shaving, wind power/solar photovoltaic power integration) were employed in the test protocols. The results showed that fractional energy storage capacity utilization and round-trip energy efficiency varied linearly with the power at which the energy was charged or discharged. A zero-dimensional electrochemical model was proposed based on the area-specific resistance to account for the energy stored/extracted during constant power discharge in the state of charge (SoC) window of 20% to 80%. It was shown that this could be used to rate a given stack in terms of charging and discharging power from the point of view of its application as a power unit. The proposed method enables stack rating based on a single polarization test and can be extended to flow battery systems in general. Full article"

On the other side, despite the increase in the battery cell raw material prices, the total production cost of battery cells requires reaching a specific value to grow cost-competitive with internal combustion vehicles. Further, obtaining a high-quality battery at the end of the production line requires integrating numerous complex processes. Thus, developing a cost model that simultaneously includes the physical and chemical characteristics of battery cells, commodities prices, process parameters, and economic aspects of a battery production plant is essential in identifying the cost-intensive areas of battery production. Moreover, such a model is helpful in finding the minimum efficient scale for the battery production plant which complies with the emergence of Giga-battery plants. In this regard, a process-based cost model (PBCM) is developed to investigate the final cost for producing ten state-of-the-art battery cell chemistries on large scales in nine locations. For a case study plant of 5.3 GWh.year −1 that produces prismatic NMC111-G battery cells, location can alter the total cost of battery cell production by approximately 47 US$/kWh, which is dominated by the labor cost. This difference could decrease by approximately 31% at the minimum efficient scale of the battery production plant, which is 7.8 GWh.year −1 for the case study in this work. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the final prices of battery cell chemistries due to the changes in commodities prices, economic factors of the plant, battery cell production parameters, and production volume. The outcomes of this work can support policy designers and battery industry leaders in managing production technology and location. Full article"
Synergistic Effect of Dual-Ceramics for Improving the Dispersion Stability and Coating Quality of Aqueous Ceramic Coating Slurries for Polyethylene Separators in Li Secondary Batteries,"Ssendagire Kennedy, Jeong-Tae Kim, Jungmin Kim, Yong Min Lee, Isheunesu Phiri, Sun-Yul Ryou",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8080082,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/82/pdf?version=1659421646,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/82,5,"We demonstrate that dispersion stability and excellent coating quality are achieved in polyethylene (PE) separators by premixing heterogeneous ceramics such as silica (SiO 2 ) and alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) in an aqueous solution, without the need for functional additives such as dispersing agents and surfactants. Due to the opposite polarities of the zeta potentials of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 forms a sheath around the Al 2 O 3 surface. Electrostatic repulsion occurs between the Al 2 O 3 particles encapsulated in SiO 2 to improve the dispersion stability of the slurry. The CCSs fabricated using a dual ceramic (SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 )-containing aqueous coating slurry, denoted as DC-CCSs, exhibit improved physical properties, such as a wetting property, electrolyte uptake, and ionic conductivity, compared to bare PE separators and CCSs coated with a single ceramic of Al 2 O 3 (SC-CCSs). Consequently, DC-CCSs exhibit an improved electrochemical performance, in terms of rate capability and cycle performance. The half cells consisting of DC-CCSs retain 93.8% (97.12 mAh g −1 ) of the initial discharge capacity after 80 cycles, while the bare PE and SC-CCSs exhibit 22.5% and 26.6% capacity retention, respectively.

We demonstrate the preparation, structural-, nanomechanical and electrochemical characteristics of molybdenum (VI) oxide (MoO 3 ) thin-film cathodes based on their different crystallinity. The nanomechanical properties of the electrode layers were determined using nanoindentation along with acoustic emission studies. Based on the electrochemical test results, as-prepared thin films that did not go under any heat treatment showed the best performance and stability throughout cycling around 50 μAh initial capacity when cycled at C/2. This suits well their nanomechanical properties, which showed the highest hardness but also the highest flexibility in comparison with the heat-treated layers with lower hardness, high brittleness, and numerous cracks upon mechanical loads. According to our results, we state that amorphous-type electrode materials are more durable against electro-chemo-mechanical-aging related battery performance loss in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries compared to their crystalline counterparts.

The aged powder was used to prepare electrodes, and the performance of these two aged samples was compared with reference fresh NMC811 electrodes in full Li-ion coin cells using graphite as a negative electrode. The cells were subjected to electrochemical as well as ante- and postmortem characterization. The performance of the electrodes from aged NM811 was beyond expectations: the cycling performance was high, and the power capability was the highest among the samples analyzed. Materials characterization revealed modifications in the crystal structure and the surface layer of the NMC811 during the storage and electrode processing steps. Differences between aged and fresh electrodes were explained by the formation of a resistive layer at the surface of the former. However, the ageing of NMC811 powder was significantly mitigated during the electrode processing step. These novel results are of interest to cell manufacturers for the widespread implementation of NMC811 as a state-of-the-art cathode material in Li-ion batteries. Full article"

However, the effect of these cations on charge storage or electrochemical performance has not been fully understood. In this study, sodium ion was taken as an example and introduced into the lithium titanium oxide (LTO) anode through the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder. After the charge/discharge cycles, these ions doped into the LTO lattice and improved both the lithium-ion diffusivity and the electronic conductivity of the anode. The sodium ion’s high concentration (>12.9%), however, resulted in internal doping of Na + into the LTO lattice, which retarded the transfer of lithium ions due to repulsion and physical blocking. The systematic study presented here shows that large cations with an appropriate concentration in the electrode would be beneficial to the electrochemical performance of the Li-ion battery.

It is of interest for use in determining state of charge and state of health. As voltage relaxation can take several hours, a representative model and curve fitting is necessary for practical usage. Previous studies of lithium-ion voltage relaxation investigate four characteristics: relationship between voltage relaxation magnitude and state of charge; length of relaxation required; model complexity for state of charge estimation; and model complexity for state of health evaluation. However, previous studies have inconsistent methodology or use only one type of lithium-ion cell, making comparison and generalization difficult. To address this, we conducted 3 h and 24 h voltage relaxation experiments over a range of states of charge on three different lithium ion chemistries (nickel cobalt aluminum NCA; nickel manganese cobalt NMC532; lithium iron phosphate LFP) and fitted them with a new voltage relaxation equivalent circuit model. It was found that a 3 h relaxation period was sufficient for NMC and LFP for state of charge and state of health investigations. Voltage relaxation of the NCA cell continued to evolve past 24 h. It was shown that voltage relaxation shape and magnitude changes as a function of state of charge, and the accuracy of estimating state of charge was explored. Strategically choosing a state of charge for state of health assessment can be optimized to accentuate voltage relaxation magnitude and this differs by chemistry. This suggested technique and experimental findings can be paired with battery degradation studies to determine accuracy of assessing state of health. Full article"

Exploiting the literature data about cradle-to-grave and cradle-to-gate investigations, and after establishing reasonable approximations, the main BP sub-elements were considered for this study, such as the plastic cells support, the Li-ion cells brick, the PCBs for a battery management system (BMS), the liquid-based battery thermal management system (BTMS) and the BP container. For each of these components, the impacts of the extraction, processing, assembly, and transportation of raw materials are estimated and the partial and total values of the energy demand (ED) and global warming potential (GWP) are determined. The final interpretation of the results allows one to understand the important role played by LCA evaluations and presents other possible ways of reducing the energy consumption and C O 2 C O 2 emissions.

Numerical Parametric Investigation of Nonaqueous Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries,"Shaopei Huang, Yujuan Lu",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8080075,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/75/pdf?version=1658564013,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/8/75,4,"Nonaqueous redox flow batteries are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage technologies. However, the effect of structural design and key factors limiting the performance are still not thoroughly understood. In this work, we constructed a physical model to study the effect of various design parameters on the performance of such a battery. It was found that the kinetics of redox reaction was improved with active material concentration and electrode surface area. The modeling results also showed that the local current density was much higher in the vicinity of membrane than near the current collector due to relatively low ionic conductivity of electrolytes. Furthermore, decreasing the electrode thickness and increasing the membrane conductivity both reduced the voltage loss associated with ohmic resistance, thereby resulting in improved battery performance. The obtained numerical simulation results would be helpful not only for understanding the physicochemical process in nonaqueous vanadium flow batteries but also for future structural optimization of these batteries.

Comparison of the Activity of 3D Binary or Ternary Cobalt Coatings for Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions,"Zita Sukackienė, Aldona Balčiūnaitė, Virginija Kepenienė, Jūratė Vaičiūnienė, Giedrius Stalnionis, Vidas Pakštas, Loreta Tamašauskaitė-Tamašiūnaitė, Eugenijus Norkus",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8090129,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/129/pdf?version=1663591971,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/129,5,"In this study, cobalt-nickel (Co-Ni), cobalt-iron (Co-Fe), cobalt-iron-manganese (Co-Fe-Mn), cobalt-iron-molybdenum (Co-Fe-Mo), and cobalt-zinc (Co-Zn) coatings were studied as catalysts towards the evolution of hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER). The binary and ternary Co coatings were deposited on a copper surface using the electroless metal plating technique and morpholine borane (MB) as a reducing agent. The as-deposited Co-Ni, Co-Fe, Co-Fe-Mn, Co-Fe-Mo, and Co-Zn coatings produce compact and crack-free layers with typical globular morphology. It was found that the Co-Fe-Mo coating gives the lowest overpotential of 128.0 mV for the HER and the lowest overpotential of 455 mV for the OER to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . The HER and OER current density values increase 1.4–2.0 times with an increase in temperature from 25 °C to 55 °C using the prepared 3D binary or ternary cobalt coatings for HER and OER. The highest mass electrocatalytic activity of 1.55 mA µg −1 for HER and 2.72 mA µg −1 for OER was achieved on the Co-Fe coating with a metal loading of 28.11 µg cm −2 at 25 °C. Full article"

Its performance and safety highly depend on its operating temperature. Therefore, a battery thermal management system is necessary to ensure an electric vehicle (EV)’s performance. Air as a cooling medium is still used in a wide range of thermal management system applications, owing to its low-cost and lightweight. However, the conventional air-based cooling strategy shows an insufficient heat dissipation capacity and usually fails to block the thermal runaway propagation between batteries. Thus, it is of great importance for improving the heat dissipation of an air-based thermal management system. In this paper, three novel schemes (schemes B, C, and D) are introduced successively based on enhancing the heat transfer capacity and safety of a battery pack under a thermal runaway condition. Schemes B and C introduce a hollow spoiler prism and a spoiler prism filled with phase-change material with fins, respectively. The cooling effects of the three schemes are compared using computational fluid dynamics technology. The models of all the schemes are 3D symmetrical structures. In the CFD model, the battery heat-generating sub-model is incorporated through a user-defined function. The results indicate that all three schemes reduce the maximum temperature and the maximum temperature difference in the pack effectively compared with the conventional air cooling system. Scheme D presents the best cooling performance and hinders the propagation of the TR between adjacent batteries under a TR condition. The paper may provide a feasible method for improving the performance of an air-cooled thermal battery management system. Full article"
Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfolane as Additives in Organic Electrolytes to Develop Room-Temperature Sodium Batteries,"Débora Ruiz-Martínez, Roberto Gómez",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8090127,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/127/pdf?version=1663207796,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/127,4,"Sodium metal anodes have attracted great attention for the development of a next generation of high-energy batteries because of their high theoretical capacity (1166 mAh·g −1 ), low redox potential (−2.71 V vs. SHE), and abundance. However, sodium reacts with most of the liquid electrolytes described to date and it has the shortcoming of dendrite formation during sodium deposition. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome these issues, including the incorporation of electrolyte additives. This work reports on the use of SO 2 and sulfolane as additives in organic electrolytes to modify the sodium–electrolyte interphase, making the sodium plating/stripping process more robust. Not only is the process more stable in the case of sodium metal anodes, but also the use of copper substrates is enabled. In fact, high-quality sodium films on copper have been attained by adding small mole fractions of the additives, which paves the way for the development of anode-free batteries. In a general vein, this work stresses the importance of researching on compatible and cost-effective additives that can be easily implemented in practice. Full article"

Preliminary results indicated Na-ion reversible intercalation but highlighted the need to find optimization strategies to improve conductivity and to modulate the operating voltages within experimentally accessible electrolytes’ stability windows, in order to fully exploit their potential as high-voltage cathodes. In this study, we combined experimental and computational techniques to investigate structures, defects, and intercalation properties of the NaFe 1-x Mn x F 3 and NaCo 1-x Mn x F 3 systems. Through the use of a simple solvothermal synthesis, we demonstrated the possibility to modulate the sample’s morphology in order to obtain fine and dispersed powder samples. The structural results indicated the formations of two solid solutions with a perovskite structure over the entire compositional range investigated. Atomistic simulations suggested that Na-ion diffusion in these systems was characterized by relatively high migration barriers and it was likely to follow three-dimensional paths, thus limiting the effect of anti-site defects. The correlation between structural and computational data highlighted the possibility to modulate both ionic and electronic conductivity as a function of the composition. Full article"
A Novel Experimental Technique for Use in Fast Parameterisation of Equivalent Circuit Models for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Mohammad Amin Samieian, Alastair Hales, Yatish Patel",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8090125,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/125/pdf?version=1663074487,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/125,15,"Battery models are one of the most important tools for understanding the behaviour of batteries. This is particularly important for the fast-moving electrical vehicle industry, where new battery chemistries are continually being developed. The main limiting factor on how fast battery models can be developed is the experimental technique used for collection of data required for model parametrisation. Currently, this is a very time-consuming process. In this paper, a fast novel parametrisation testing technique is presented. A model is then parametrised using this testing technique and compared to a model parametrised using current common testing techniques. This comparison is conducted using a WLTP (worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure) drive cycle. As part of the validation, the experiments were conducted at different temperatures and repeated using two different temperature control methods: climate chamber and a Peltier element temperature control method. The new technique introduced in this paper, named AMPP (accelerated model parametrisation procedure), is as good as GITT (galvanostatic intermittent titration technique) for parametrisation of ECMs (equivalent circuit models); however, it is 90% faster. When using experimental data from a climate chamber, a model parametrised using GITT was marginally better than AMPP; however, when using experimental data using conductive control, such as the ICP (isothermal control platform), a model parametrised using AMPP performed as well as GITT at 25 °C and better than GITT at 10 °C.

Because of its importance, the electricity industry has historically been controlled and operated by governmental entities. The power market is being deregulated, and it has been modified throughout time. Both regulated and deregulated electricity markets have benefits and pitfalls in terms of energy costs, efficiency, and environmental repercussions. In regulated markets, policy-based strategies are often used to deal with the costs of fossil fuel resources and increase the feasibility of renewable energy sources. Renewables may be incorporated into deregulated markets by a mix of regulatory and market-based approaches, as described in this paper, to increase the systems economic stability. As the demand for energy has increased substantially in recent decades, particularly in developing nations, the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions has increased fast, as have fuel prices, which are the primary motivators for programmers to use renewable energy sources more effectively. Despite its obvious benefits, renewable energy has considerable drawbacks, such as irregularity in generation, because most renewable energy supplies are climate-dependent, demanding complex design, planning, and control optimization approaches. Several optimization solutions have been used in the renewable-integrated deregulated power system. Energy storage technology has risen in relevance as the usage of renewable energy has expanded, since these devices may absorb electricity generated by renewables during off-peak demand hours and feed it back into the grid during peak demand hours. Using renewable energy and storing it for future use instead of expanding fossil fuel power can assist in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There is a desire to maximize the societal benefit of a deregulated system by better using existing power system capacity through the implementation of an energy storage system (ESS). As a result, good ESS device placement offers innovative control capabilities in steady-state power flow regulation as well as dynamic stability management. This paper examines numerous elements of renewable integrated deregulated power systems and gives a comprehensive overview of the most current research breakthroughs in this field. The main objectives of the reviews are the maximization of system profit, maximization of social welfare and minimization of system generation cost and loss by optimal placement of energy storage devices and renewable energy systems. This study will be very helpful for the power production companies who want to build new renewable-based power plant by sighted the present status of renewable energy sources along with the details of several EES systems. The incorporation of storage devices in the renewable-incorporated deregulated system will provide maximum social benefit by supplying additional power to the thermal power plant with minimum cost.

Many different second life applications have been proposed, each with multiple criteria that have to be taken into consideration when deciding the most suitable course of action. In this article, a battery assessment procedure is proposed that consolidates and expands upon the approaches in the literature, and facilitates the decision-making process for a battery after it has reached the end of its first life. The procedure is composed of three stages, including an evaluation of the state of the battery, an evaluation of the technical viability and an economic evaluation. Options for battery configurations are explored (pack direct use, stack of battery packs, module direct use, pack refurbish with modules, pack refurbish with cells). By comparing these configurations with the technical requirements for second life applications, a reader can rapidly understand the tradeoffs and practical strategies for how best to implement second life batteries for their specific application. Lastly, an economic evaluation process is developed to determine the cost of implementing various second life battery configurations and the revenue for different end use applications. An example of the battery assessment procedure is included to demonstrate how it could be carried out. Full article"

In this context, considerable efforts have been made in the last few years to overcome the limitations and optimise the performance of this technology, aiming to make it commercially competitive. From the monitoring point of view, one of the biggest challenges is the estimation of the system internal states, such as the state of charge and the state of health, given the complexity of obtaining such information directly from experimental measures. Therefore, many proposals have been recently developed to get rid of such inconvenient measurements and, instead, utilise an algorithm that makes use of a mathematical model in order to rely only on easily measurable variables such as the system’s voltage and current. This review provides a comprehensive study of the different types of dynamic models available in the literature, together with an analysis of the existing model-based estimation strategies. Finally, a discussion about the remaining challenges and possible future research lines on this field is presented. Full article"

They have a long service life, low self-discharge, are fire safe and can be used to create a large-scale storage system. The characteristics of the flow battery are determined by the parameters of its main components: a stack determines the battery power and its efficiency, and an electrolyte determines the battery’s capacity and service life. Several stacks must be combined into one system to create a powerful energy storage system; however, the discharge characteristics differ even for two identical stacks connected in parallel. This article proposes hydrodynamic and electrotechnical methods for ensuring the parallel operation of several flow stacks under the same conditions. Full article"

Additionally, it is shown here that all the parameters ( C m , n , i 0 and i k ) in the Peukert generalized equations under study have a clear physical meaning, unlike in the classical Peukert equation, in which all the parameters are just empirical constants. In addition, it is shown that, in the case of lithium-ion batteries, the dependence of their released capacity on the discharge current reflects the phase transition statistical pattern in the electrodes’ active substance, which follows the normal distribution law. As the Peukert equation is used in many analytical models, the better electrochemical and physical meaning and understanding of this equation and its clarification are of great practical importance.

Here, we report the hydrothermal synthesis of several types of WS 2 nanostructures and their performance as magnesium battery cathodes. The morphology of WS 2 materials was controlled through the use of sodium oxalate as a complexing agent and different templating agents, including polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). A high capacity of 142.7 mAh/g was achieved after 100 cycles at a high current density of 500 mA/g for cathodes based on a nanostructured flower-like WS 2 . A solution consisting of magnesium (II) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (MgTFSI 2 ) and magnesium (II) chloride (MgCl 2 ) in dimethoxyethane (DME) was used as an effective electrolyte, which contributes to favorable Mg 2+ mobility. Weaker ionic bonds and van der Waals forces of WS 2 compared with other transition metal oxides/sulfides lay the foundation for fast discharge/charge rate. The enhanced surface area of the nanostructured materials plays a key role in enhancing both the capacity and discharge/charge rate. Full article"

Nevertheless, the limited initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC is the main bottleneck hindering its practical application. To alleviate this issue, herein, a ZrO 2 coating was skillfully constructed by using a facile liquid phase coating method. The ZrO 2 coating can act as a physical barrier to prevent direct contact between the HC surface and the electrolyte, thus effectively reducing irreversible sodium adsorption and inhibiting the continuous decomposition of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, this fresh interface can contribute to the generation of a thinner solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with high ionic conductivity. As a result, the ICE of the ZrO 2 -coated HC electrode can be optimized up to 79.2% (64.4% for pristine HC). Furthermore, the ZrO 2 -coated HC electrode delivers outstanding cyclic stability so that the capacity retention rate can reach 82.6% after 2000 cycles at 1 A g −1 (55.8% for pristine HC). This work provides a flexible and versatile surface modification method to improve the electrochemical property of HC, and hopefully accelerate the practical application of HC anodes for SIBs.

In this work, porous nitrogen-doped carbon (PNC) was obtained by removing template nanoparticles from the thermal decomposition products of calcium glutarate and acetonitrile vapor. The treatment of PNC with a KOH melt led to the etching of the carbon shells at the nitrogen sites, which caused the replacement of some nitrogen species by hydroxyl groups and the opening of pores. The attached hydroxyl groups interacted with Br 2 molecules, resulting in a higher bromine content in the brominated pre-activated sample (5 at%) than in the brominated PNC (3 at%). Tests of the obtained materials in SIBs showed that KOH activation has little effect on the specific capacity of PNC, while bromination significantly improves the performance. The largest gain was achieved for brominated KOH-activated PNC, which was able to deliver 234 and 151 mAh g −1 at 0.05 and 1 A g −1 , respectively, and demonstrated stable long-term operation at 0.25 and 0.5 A g −1 . The improvement was related to the separation of graphitic layers due to Br 2 intercalation and polarization of the carbon surface by covalently attached functional groups. Our results suggest a new two-stage modification strategy to improve the storage and high-rate capability of carbon materials in SIBs. Full article"

Among the variety of anodes, alloying-type anodes are superior due to their high gravimetric capacity and stability. In the present work, zinc metal was implemented as electrode material in an all-solid-state lithium-ion battery. This anode material was tested with two different solid-state electrolytes, i.e., lithium borohydride (LiBH 4 ) and halide-stabilized LiBH 4 (i.e., LiBH 4 .LiI). In a coin cell, Li foil was placed as a counter electrode. The establishment of a reaction mechanism during the charging and discharging was obtained through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Systematic studies using the temperature dependence performance were also conducted. The volumetric density with both electrolytes was found at more than 3000 mAh/cm 3 . The coulombic efficiency for the electrode material was also observed at ~94%.

However, the acquired capacity suffers from poor accuracy caused by the inadequate utilization of battery information and the limitation of a single estimation method. This paper investigates an innovative fusion method based on the information fusion technique for battery capacity estimation, considering the actual working conditions of EVs. Firstly, a general framework for battery capacity estimation and fusion is proposed and two conventional capacity estimation methods running in different EV operating conditions are revisited. The error covariance of different estimations is deduced to evaluate the estimation uncertainties. Then, a fusion state–space function is constructed and realized through the Kalman filter to achieve the adaptive fusion of multi-dimensional capacity estimation. Several experiments simulating the actual battery operations in EVs are designed and performed to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than conventional methods, obtaining more accurate and stable capacity estimation under different aging statuses. Finally, a practical judgment criterion for the current deviation fault is proposed based on fusion capacity. Full article"
Electrochemical Properties of LiFePO4Cathodes: The Effect of Carbon Additives,"Irina Stenina, Polina Minakova, Tatiana Kulova, Andrey Yaroslavtsev",2022,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries8090111,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/111/pdf?version=1662360681,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/8/9/111,29,"The influence of different conductive additives (carbon nanofibers (CNFs), carbon nanoplatelets, and pyrolytic carbon from sucrose (Sucr) or polyvinylidene fluoride) on the morphology, electron conductivity, and electrochemical performance of LiFePO 4 -based cathodes was investigated to develop the most efficient strategy for the fabrication of high-rate cathodes. Pyrolytic carbon effectively prevents the growth of LiFePO 4 grains and provides contact between them, CNFs provide fast long-range conductive pathways, while carbon nanoplatelets can be embedded in carbon coatings as high-conductive “points” which enhance the rate capability and decrease the capacity fading of LFP. The LiFePO 4 /C Sucr /CNF showed better performance than the other cathodes due to the synergy of the high-conductive CNF network (the electronic conductivity was 1.3 × 10 −2 S/cm) and the shorter Li + ion path (the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient was 2.1 × 10 −11 cm 2 /s). It is shown that the formation of composites based on LFP and carbon nanomaterials via mortar grinding is a more promising strategy for electrode material manufacturing than ball milling.

However, it has been shown that this approach does not optimize long-term profitability, as it neglects battery degradation. Since a battery can perform a limited number of cycles during its lifetime, it may be better to operate the battery only when profits are on the high side. Researchers have dealt with this issue using various strategies to restrain battery usage, reducing short-term benefits in exchange for an increase in long-term profits. Determining this operation restraint is a topic scarcely developed in the literature. It is common to arbitrarily quantify degradation impact into short-term operation, which has proven to have an extensive impact on long-term results. This paper carries out a critical review of different methods of degradation control for short-time operation. A classification of different practices found in the literature is presented. Strengths and weaknesses of each approach are pointed out, and future possible contributions to this topic are remarked upon. The most common methodology is implemented in a simulation for demonstration purposes. Full article"

The structural properties and composition of the germanium microrods were studied by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical studies of germanium nanowires were carried out by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that the addition of vinylene carbonate (VC) in the electrolyte significantly reduced the irreversible capacity during the first charge/discharge cycles and increased the long-term cycling stability of the Ge microrods. The obtained results will benefit the further design of Ge microrods-based anodes that are formed by simple electrochemical deposition. Full article

Hard carbon (HC) is a well-studied anode material for SIBs; however, the performance as a function of temperature is less established. To investigate temperature dependence of the performance of HC, sodium half-cells with a common NaClO 4 -based electrolyte were tested at temperatures from 10 to 80 °C. Capacity after 20 cycles at 100 mA g −1 current varied from 90 mA h g −1 at 10 °C to 270 mA h g −1 at 60 °C. Increased temperature significantly improves the HC rate capability, with 120 mA h g −1 capacity found at 60 °C with 500 mA g −1 current.

Some unexpected changes can happen depending on the drying conditions. In prior work, we developed the multiphase-smoothed-particle (MPSP) model, which predicted a relative increase in the carbon additive and binder adjacent to the current collector during drying. This motivated us to undertake the present experimental investigation of the relationship between the drying rate and microstructure and transport properties for a typical anode and cathode. Specifically, the drying rate was controlled by means of temperature for both an NMC532 cathode and graphite anode. The material distribution was analyzed using a combination of cross-section SEM images and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental maps. The binder concentration gradients were developed in both the in- and through-plane directions. The through-plane gradient is evident at a temperature higher than 150 °C, whereas the in-plane variations resulted at all drying temperatures. The measurements identified an optimum temperature (80 °C) that results in high electronic conductivity and low ionic resistivity due to a more uniform binder distribution. Trends in transport properties are not significantly altered by calendering, which highlights the importance of the drying rate itself on the assembled cell properties. Full article"

However, the overwhelming challenge that has prevented the implementation of next-generation Zn batteries lies in their poor rechargeability—flowing electrolytes have proven to be of benefit to zinc deposition and dissolution cycling, but the rapid zinc deposition–dissolution at practical current densities of 100 mA cm 2 or over is still questionable. Herein, we demonstrated that applying an optimal concentration of quaternary ammonium electrolyte additives with carefully selected cations’ alkyl groups can effectively improve the high-rate zinc cycling performance at 100 mA cm 2 /20 mAh cm 2 . The resultant additives significantly reduced the initial coulombic efficiency loss to only 1.11% with coulombic efficiency decay rate of 0.79% per cycle, which is less than a quarter of the benchmark of 6.25% and 3.75% per cycle for no additives.

They power electronics and determine the system run time, with the size and volume determining factors in their design and implementation. Understanding the material properties of the battery components—anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator—and their interaction is necessary to establish selection criteria based on their correlations with the battery metrics: capacity, current density, and cycle life. This review studies material used in the four battery components from the perspective and the impact of seven ions (Li [Math Processing Error] + , Na [Math Processing Error] + , K [Math Processing Error] + , Zn [Math Processing Error] 2 + , Ca [Math Processing Error] 2 + , Mg [Math Processing Error] 2 + , and Al [Math Processing Error] 3 + ), employed in commercial and research batteries.

These are key aspects toward identifying the supply chain vulnerabilities and gaps for batteries. In addition, two battery applications, smartphones and electric vehicles, in light of challenges in the current research, commercial fronts, and technical prospects, are discussed. Bringing the next generation of batteries necessitates a transition from advances in material to addressing the technical challenges, which the review has powered. Full article"

Hereby, the Kalman filter is a frequently used and well-known tool to estimate the states and model parameters of a lithium-ion cell. A strong requirement is the selection of a suitable model and a reasonable initialization, otherwise the algorithm’s estimation might be insufficient. Especially the process noise parametrization poses a difficult task, since it is an abstract parameter and often optimized by an arbitrary trial-and-error principle. In this work, a traceable procedure based on the genetic algorithm is introduced to determine the process noise offline considering the estimation error and filter consistency. Hereby, the parameters found are independent of the researcher’s experience. Results are validated with a simulative and experimental study, using an NCA/graphite lithium-ion cell. After the transient phase, the estimation error of the state-of-charge is lower than 0.6% and for internal resistance smaller than 4mΩ while the corresponding estimated covariances fit the error well.

Sodium polyaluminate is successfully employed in established Na–S and Na–NiCl 2 cell systems. It is a promising candidate for all-solid-state sodium batteries. However, humidity affects the performance of this solid electrolyte. In this work, the effect of humidity on disk-shaped samples of Li-stabilized sodium-beta alumina stored in three different environments is quantified. We used impedance analysis and additional characterizations to investigate the consequences of the occurring degradation, namely ion exchange and subsequent buildup of surface layers. Sodium-beta alumina’s ionic conductivity gradually deteriorates up to two orders of magnitude. This is due to layers developed superficially during storage, while its fracture strength of 240 MPa remains unaffected. Changes in microstructure, composition, and cycle life of Na|BASE|Na cells highlight the importance of proper storage conditions: In just one week of improper storage, the critical current density collapsed from the maximum of 9.1 mA cm −2 , one of the highest values reported for sodium-beta alumina, to 1.7 mA cm −2 at 25 °C. The results validate former observations regarding sodium-beta alumina’s moisture sensitivity and suggest how to handle sodium-beta alumina used in electrochemical cell systems. Full article"

Therefore, thermal battery system models, which allow for the calculation of these distributions, are required. In this work, a generic thermal equivalent circuit model for commercial battery modules with passive cooling is introduced. The model approach can be easily adopted to varying system designs and sizes and is accompanied by a corresponding low-effort characterization process. The validation of the model was performed on both synthetic and measured load profiles from stationary and marine applications. The results show that the model can represent both the average temperature and the occurring temperature spread (maximum to minimum temperature) with deviations below 1 K. In addition to the introduced full-scale model, further simplifying assumptions were tested in order to reduce the computational effort required by the model. By comparing the resulting simplified models with the original full-scale model, it can be shown that both reducing the number of simulated cells and assuming electrical homogeneity between the cells in the module offer a reduction in the computation time within one order of magnitude while still retaining a high model accuracy.

To address this, this paper proposes the establishment of an Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT)-based digital twin (DT) through the Microsoft Azure services, incorporating components for data collection, time synchronization, processing, modeling, and decision visualization. Within this framework, the readily available measurements in the LIB module, including voltage, current, and operating temperature, are utilized, providing advanced information about the LIBs’ SOC and facilitating accurate determination of the electric vehicle (EV) range. This proposed data-driven SOC-estimation-based DT framework was developed with a supervised voting ensemble regression machine learning (ML) approach using the Azure ML service. To facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of historical driving cycles and ensure the SOC-estimation-based DT framework is accurate, this study used three application programming interfaces (APIs), namely Google Directions API, Google Elevation API, and OpenWeatherMap API, to collect the data and information necessary for analyzing and interpreting historical driving patterns, for the reference EV model, which closely emulates the dynamics of a real-world battery electric vehicle (BEV). Notably, the findings demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 1.1446 and 0.02385 through simulation and experimental studies, respectively. The study’s results offer valuable insights that can inform further research on developing estimation and predictive maintenance systems for industrial applications. Full article"

Within the present study, we propose a novel approach for monitoring the temperature of batteries by means of infrared thermography. In order to improve the accuracy of the performed measurements and to overcome the limitations imposed by the cylindrical housing of the batteries, we have developed a unique method for monitoring and capturing the temperature of the battery over the entire housing. An experimental system was built, through which the battery performs a rotational movement relative to its axis, with this rotation motion being synchronized with the frame rate of the thermal camera. The resulting thermographic images are processed using specifically developed software. This software enables the segmentation of certain sections of the battery’s surface from a defined spatial perspective. These selected segments are subsequently utilized to generate a three-dimensional representation of the battery’s surface temperature’s distribution. In this way, errors in the obtained results which are caused by the viewing angle are avoided. Additionally, we developed and presented a method for the increasing of the resolution of captured thermograms. Full article"

We verified changes in the shape of the voltage relaxation curve based on battery impedance through simulations and analyzed the impact of individual impedance on the voltage relaxation curve using differential equations. Based on this relationship, we estimated the impedance from the battery’s voltage relaxation curve through curve fitting and subsequently estimated the state of charge using a pre-established lookup table. In addition, we introduced a partial curve-fitting method to reduce the estimation time compared to the existing open-circuit voltage method and confirmed the trade-off relationship between the estimation time and estimation error.

The high interest is due to its low raw material cost, good electrochemical stability, and high-capacity retention. However, poor electronic conductivity and a low Li + diffusion rate decrease its electrochemical reactivity, especially at fast charge/discharge rates. In this work, the volumetric energy density of lithium-ion batteries is successfully increased by using different amounts of conductive carbon (Super P) in the active material content. The particle size and morphology of the electrode material samples are studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Two-point-probe DC measurements and adhesive force tests are used to determine the conductivity and evaluate adhesion for the positive electrode. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and charge/discharge tests are used to analyze the electrochemical properties of the battery. The samples containing 88% LFP, 5.5% Super P, and 6.5% PVDF perform best, with discharge capacities reaching 169.8 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, and they can also manage charging/discharging of 5 C. EIS indicates that this combination produces the lowest charge-transfer impedance (67 Ω) and the highest Li + ion diffusion coefficient (5.76 × 10 −14 cm 2 s −1 ). Full article"

During the mechanical process of the recycling of the LIB cells, a fine fraction, the so-called black mass, is created. This black mass consists mostly of the coatings originating from the cells’ electrodes and residues from the electrolyte, together with a low amount of Al and Cu from the crushed current collector foils. The amount of black mass as well as its composition is influenced by the chosen grid size at the crusher discharge. To reduce solvent emissions during the recycling process, a thermal pre-treatment can be added before crushing, which also influences the black mass and its properties due to changes in the adhesion between electrode foils and coating. This study investigates the influence of the crusher settings as well as the pre-treatment temperatures to find an optimum between the recovery of the coating and conductive salt, while limiting the amount of Al and Cu in the black mass.

Two heating power levels were used to trigger thermal runaway in order to investigate the influence of heating power on thermal runaway characteristics and the mitigation effect of the PCM (phase change material). Thermal runaway processes and temperature changes were recorded. The results showed that heating results in a violent reaction of the battery, generating a high temperature and a bright flame, and the burning of PA increases the duration of a steady flame, indicating an increased threat. SA (sodium acetate trihydrate) effectively inhibited PA combustion, and the combustion time was reduced by 40.5%. PA/SA effectively retarded the rise in temperature of the battery, and the temperature rise rate was reduced by 87.3%. Increased heating power caused faster thermal runaway, and the thermal runaway mitigation effect of the CPCM was dramatically reduced.

The maximum specific capacitance of 7.77 F g −1 and power density of 287.7 W kg −1 were measured, and stable capacitance retention of 94% was achieved after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge with harsh input conditions. The biodegradability was also confirmed by the degraded mucilage film in soil after 30 days. The plant-driven chia mucilage gel electrolyte can facilitate the realization of flexible supercapacitors for the energy storage devices of the future. Full article"
An Enhanced Single-Particle Model Using a Physics-Informed Neural Network Considering Electrolyte Dynamics for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Chenyu Xue, Bo Jiang, Jiangong Zhu, Xuezhe Wei, Haifeng Dai",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9100511,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/10/511/pdf?version=1697531539,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/10/511,20,"As power sources for electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have many advantages, such as high energy density and wide temperature range. In the algorithm design process for LIBs, various battery models with different model structures are needed, among which the electrochemical model is widely used due to its high accuracy. However, the electrochemical model is composed of multiple nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that make the simulating process time-consuming. In this paper, a physics-informed neural network single-particle model (PINN SPM) is proposed to improve the accuracy of the single-particle model (SPM) under high C-rates, while ensuring high solving speed. In PINN SPM, an SPM-Net is designed to solve the distribution of lithium-ion concentration in the electrolyte. In the neural network learning process, a loss function is designed based on the physical constraints brought by the PDEs, which reduces the error of the neural network under dynamic working conditions. Finally, the PINN SPM proposed in this paper can achieve a maximum relative error of up to 1.2% compared with the high-fidelity data generated from the P2D model under various conditions. Additionally, the PINN SPM is 20.8% faster than traditional numerical solution methods with the same computational resources. Full article"

Understanding the dynamics of Li + transportation and the influence of the host lattice is the prerequisite for developing advanced Metal halide SSEs. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD), as the most cutting-edge technology, could essentially reflect the nuclear density map to determine the whole crystal structure. Through NPD, the Li+ distribution and occupation are clearly revealed for transport pathway analysis, and the influence of the host ion lattice on Li+ migration could be discussed. In this review, we stress NPD utilization in metal halide SSEs systems in terms of defect chemistry, phase transition, cation/anion disorder effects, dual halogen, lattice dynamics/polarizability, and in situ analysis of phase evolution. The irreplaceable role of NPD technology in designing metal halide SSEs with enhanced properties is stressed, and a perspective on future developments of NPD in metal halide SSEs is also presented.

The algorithm integrates techniques of adaptive recursive least squares and dual adaptive extended Kalman filtering to enhance robustness, mitigate data saturation, and reduce the impact of colored noise. At 25 °C, the algorithm is tested and verified under dynamic stress test (DST) and Beijing bus DST conditions. Under the Beijing bus DST condition, the algorithm achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.19% for SOC estimation, with a convergence time of 4 s. Under the DST condition, the corresponding values are 0.05% for MAE, 0.07% for RMSE, and 5 s for convergence time. Moreover, in this research, the SOH is described as having internal resistance. Under the Beijing bus DST condition, the MAE and the RMSE of the estimated internal resistance of the proposed approach are 0.018% and 0.075%, with the corresponding values of 0.014% and 0.043% under the DST condition.

In this research, an advanced approach was used involving fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based sensors that were developed and implemented for the measurement of the key parameters required to ensure optimum battery performance. In this work, one of the biggest challenges to assess (and then map) the data from the sensor system developed is tackled in order to better understand the key parameters of the battery in an efficient and improved way. It is well known that the relationship between the changes in the resonance wavelength of the FBGs used in the sensor system, arising due to change in the electrical parameters of the battery, is complex and dependent on several different factors. In this work, this effect was evaluated by coupling the sensor data to a data-driven regression model approach that was developed for the measurement of the SOC of the batteries used, and this was obtained directly and conveniently from the FBG data. In this comprehensive study, FBG-based sensors were fabricated and then installed onto the battery, which then was subjected to a range of charging–discharging cycles, following which the electrical parameters of the battery were estimated from recorded data using a black-box machine learning (ML) model. Data-driven regression algorithms were employed for the training of the black-box model. The efficiency of the estimation of the SOC of the battery from the FBG-based sensor data was found to be high, at 99.62% (R 2 values of Estimated SOC and True SOC line), creating a very satisfactory result for this key measurement. Thus, the work shows the robustness of the FBG-based sensor system combined with the neural network algorithm as an effective way to evaluate the electrical parameters of the battery, which is particularly important, as no physical/electrochemical/electrical model of the system is thus required.

Their combination in hybrid battery cells enables the use of their individual benefits while mitigating their disadvantages. The cubic stuffed garnet Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZO), for example, is stable in contact with metallic lithium but has only moderate ionic conductivity, whereas the thiophosphate Li 10 SnP 2 S 12 (LSPS) is processable using conventional battery manufacturing technologies and has an excellent lithium-ion conductivity but an inferior electrochemical stability. In this work, we, therefore, present a layered hybrid all-solid-state full-cell concept that accommodates a lithium metal anode, a LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 -based composite cathode with an LSPS catholyte (LSPS/NCM811) and a sintered monolithic LLZO separator. The electrochemical stability of LLZO and LSPS at cathodic potentials (up to 4.2 V) was investigated via cyclic voltammetry in test cells, as well as by cycling half cells with LSPS or a mixed LSPS/LLZO catholyte. Furthermore, the pressure-dependency of the galvanostatic cycling of a Li | LLZO | LSPS/NCM811 full cell was investigated, as well as the according effect of the Li | LLZO interface in symmetric test cells. An operation pressure of 12.5 MPa was identified as the optimal value, which assures both sufficient inter-layer contact and impeded lithium penetration through the separator and cell short-circuiting.

Even though SSBs with ISSEs have been extensively investigated over the last two decades, they still exhibit a series of technological drawbacks. In fact, mechano-chemical issues, mainly the stability of the electrolyte/anode interface, hinder their widespread application. The present investigation focusses on a thin-film LMO (Lithium-Manganese-Oxide)/LAGP (LiAlGe Phosphate)/Copper, anodeless Lithium-metal battery and explores the morphochemical evolution of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces with synchrotron-based Scanning Photoelectron Microscopy (SPEM) of intact pristine and cycled cells. Chemical images were acquired with submicrometer resolution, to highlight the coupled geometrical and chemical-state changes caused by electrochemical ageing. Geometrical changes of the electrolyte/cathode interface were induced by periodic volume changes, causing de-cohesion of the solid-solid contact, but no chemical-state changes accompany the cathodic damaging mode. Instead, shape changes of the electrolyte/anode region pinpoint the correlation between mechanical damaging with the decomposition of the LAGP ISSE, due to the reduction of Ge, triggered by the contact with elemental Li. The micro-spectroscopic approach adopted in this study enabled the assessment of the highly localized nature of the cathodic and anodic degradation modes in SSB devices and to single out the chemical and mechanical contributions.

The hierarchical confinement effect of three-dimensional conductive networks can not only improve electrode stability upon cycling via suppressing the large volume variation, but also eliminate the band gap of Bi and accelerate ion diffusion, thereby exhibiting favorable electrochemical reaction kinetics.

Lithium-ion battery (LIB) has emerged as the main tool for energy storage in electric vehicles. A widespread adoption of EVs, however, requires a fast-charging technology that can significantly reduce charging time while avoiding any unsafe conditions including short circuits due to failure of the separator in an LIB cell. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the mechanical stresses during fast charging and their long-term effect on the integrity of the separator. This paper presents a novel hybrid model for the prediction of the stress distribution in the separator of a pouch cell under various charging speeds, ambient temperatures, and pack assembly conditions, such as compressive pressures. The proposed hybrid model consists of three sub-models, namely, an electrochemical cell model, a lumped-parameter model, and a solid mechanics model. A robust parameter identification scheme is implemented to determine the model parameters using the experimental data. The separator within the test setup will experience maximum von Mises stress of 74 MPa during 4C charging, i.e., when the charge current in A is four times as high as the capacity of the battery cell in Ah. To assess the evolution of the damage in the separator under the estimated stress during fast charging, creep and fatigue tests are conducted on the separator. Their results indicate a progressive accumulation of damage in the separator, further emphasizing the importance of understanding and mitigating mechanical degradation in separator materials.

However, different pack configurations and battery module collector positions result in different equivalent connected resistances, leading to pack current inhomogeneity, which seriously reduces the lifetime and safety of the pack. Therefore, in order to quantitatively analyze the influence of the connected resistance on the current distribution, this study researched the initial cell current distribution of the parallel module by developing mathematical models of different configurations. Then, this study explored the influence of multiple module collector positions on the current inhomogeneity of the pack under the dynamic current condition. The results show that the inhomogeneity of cell current and discharge capacity in the pack with parallel modules connected in series can be improved by keeping each cell in a parallel module with the same distance to its module collector. Furthermore, the current homogeneity of the edge parallel modules in the pack is seriously affected by the position of the single module collector. Therefore, this study innovatively proposes the symmetrical multiple module collectors of the pack, which can greatly improve the current homogeneity of the edge parallel modules, thereby improving the lifetime and safety of the pack.

We investigate the electrochemical redox reactions of calcium ions within TiS 2 and assess its suitability for use in aqueous CIBs. Additionally, we examine the impact of varying electrolyte concentrations, ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 mol dm −3 , on TiS 2 electrode reactions. Our findings reveal that TiS 2 exhibits distinct charge–discharge behaviors in various aqueous calcium-ion electrolytes. Notably, at higher electrolyte concentrations, TiS 2 effectively suppresses the hydrogen generation reaction caused by water decomposition. In situ X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the intercalation of Ca 2+ ions between the TiS 2 layers during charging, which is a groundbreaking discovery, signifying TiS 2 ’s applicability in aqueous CIBs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis further supports the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the TiS 2 electrode surface, contributing to the suppression of electrolyte decomposition reactions. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of anions in the electrolyte on charge–discharge behavior. Our findings suggest that the choice of anion coordinated with Ca 2+ ions affects the SEI formation and cycling performance. Understanding the role of anions in SEI formation is crucial for optimizing aqueous CIBs. In conclusion, this research underscores TiS 2 ’s potential as an active material for aqueous calcium-ion batteries and emphasizes the importance of the electrolyte composition in influencing SEI formation and battery performance, contributing to sustainable and efficient energy storage technologies.

To achieve accurate and stable SOC estimation results, this paper proposes a model-based method, which incorporates a vector forgetting factor least square (VFFLS) algorithm and an improved adaptive cubature Kalman filter (IACKF). Firstly, considering it is difficult for the traditional forgetting factor recursive least square (FFRLS) algorithm to balance the accuracy, convergence, and stability for multiple parameters with different time-varying periods, an improved VFFLS method is employed to determine the multiple parameters of the first-order RC battery model online. It supersedes the single forgetting factor in the FFRLS with multiple forgetting factors in a vector form for improving adaptive capability to multiple time-varying parameters. Secondly, aiming at the fact that the standard cubature Kalman filter (CKF) cannot operate properly when the error covariance matrix is non-positive definite, which is caused by disturbance, initial error, and the limit of the computer word length, the UR decomposition rather than the Cholesky decomposition is applied, thus improving the algorithm stability. In addition, an adaptive update strategy is added to the CKF to enhance accuracy and convergence speed. Finally, comparative experiments with different operating patterns, positive and non-positive definite error covariance matrices, and temperatures are carried out. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can estimate the SOC accurately and stably. Full article"

The structure, morphology, and oxidation state of transition metal ions for Co-substituted and MgO-treated oxides are carefully examined via X-ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopies, FESEM with EDX, specific surface area measurement, and XPS spectroscopy. The ability of oxides to store sodium reversibly is analyzed within a temperature range of 10 to 50 °C via CV experiments, galvanostatic measurements, and EIS, using half and full sodium ion cells. The changes in the local structure and oxidation state of transition metal ions during Na + intercalation are monitored via operando XAS experiments. It is found that the Co substituents have a positive impact on the rate capability of layered oxides, while Mg additives lead to a strong increase in the capacity and an enhancement of the cycling stability.

Triggering and Characterisation of Realistic Internal Short Circuits in Lithium-Ion Pouch Cells—A New Approach Using Precise Needle Penetration,"Jens Grabow, Jacob Klink, Nury Orazov, Ralf Benger, Ines Hauer, Hans-Peter Beck",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9100496,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/10/496/pdf?version=1724063353,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/10/496,8,"The internal short circuit (ISC) in lithium-ion batteries is a serious problem since it is probably the most common cause of a thermal runaway (TR) that still presents many open questions, even though it has been intensively investigated. Therefore, this article focusses on the generation and characterisation of the local single-layer ISC, which is typically caused by cell-internal impurity particles that cannot be completely eliminated in the cell production. A new, very promising method of precise and slow (1 μ μ m s − 1 − 1 ) needle penetration made it possible to generate the most safety-critical reliable short-circuit type—the contact between the Al-Collector and the graphite active material of the anode—as demonstrated on a 10 Ah Graphite/NMC pouch cell. The special efforts in achieving high reproducibility as well as the detailed analysis of the initiated internal short-circuit conditions led to more reliable and meaningful results. A comprehensive approach to characterisation has been made by detailed measurement of the dynamic short-circuit evolution and a subsequent post-characterisation, which included the application of different electrochemical measurement techniques as well as a post-abuse analysis. It was shown that the cells demonstrated a very individual and difficult-to-predict behaviour, which is a major challenge for early failure detection and risk assessment of cells with an existing or former ISC. On the one hand, it is found that despite high local temperatures of over 1260 ∘ ∘ C and significant damage to the cell-internal structure, the cell did not develop a TR even with further cycling. On the other hand, it was observed that the TR occurs spontaneously without any previous abnormalities. Based on the overall test results, it was shown that at the high state of charge (SOC = 100%), even small, dynamically developing voltage drops (<10 mV) must be classified as safety-critical for the cell. For reliable and early failure detection, the first voltage drops of the ISC must already be detected. Full article"

Thus, in this work, the influence of the calcination time on the electrochemical performance and the reaction mechanism during cycling were investigated. NTO heat-treated for 48 h at 800 °C (NTO-48h) demonstrated enhanced cycling performance in comparison to NTO heat-treated for only 8 h (NTO-8h). The pristine material was thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction, laser granulometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and specific surface area measurements. The reaction mechanisms induced by sodiation/desodiation and cycling were investigated by operando XRD. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to evidence the evolution of the solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI) and modification of charge transfer resistances as well as the influence of cycling on capacity decay. The evolution of the crystallographic structure of NTO-48h revealed a more ordered structure and lower surface contamination compared to NTO-8h. Moreover, the residual Na 4 Ti 3 O 7 phase detected after the sodium extraction step in NTO-8h seems correlated to the lower electrochemical performance of NTO-8h compared to NTO-48h. Full article"

In this study, an online SoH estimator approach for NMC Li-ion batteries is presented which is suitable for implementation in a BMS. It is based on an observer structure in which the difference between a calculated and expected open-circuit voltage (OCV) is used for online SoH estimation. The estimator is parameterized and evaluated using real measurement data. The data were recorded for more than two years on an electrified bus fleet of 10 buses operated in a mild European climate and used regularly in the urban transport sector. Each bus is equipped with four NMC Li-ion batteries. Every battery has an energy of 30.6 kWh. Additionally, two full-capacity checkup measurements were performed for one of the operated batteries: one directly after production and one after two years of operation. Initial validation results demonstrated a SoH estimation accuracy of ±0.5% compared to the last checkup measurement. Full article"

Therefore, the development of high-performance flexible energy storage devices is of great significance for promoting flexible electronics. In recent years, one-dimensional flexible fiber lithium-ion batteries have been rapidly developed due to their advantages of high flexibility and bendability. However, it remains highly challenging to realize 1D flexible fiber lithium-ion batteries with excellent electrochemical properties and good mechanical performance. In this work, a reduced graphene oxide-based printing ink is proposed for the fabrication of flexible Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 /graphene fiber electrodes using a 3D printing assembly strategy. It is noteworthy that the green reducing agent vitamin C was used to reduce the graphene oxide in one step, which improved the conductivity of the fiber electrode. Furthermore, a 3D conductive network was constructed inside the fiber electrodes due to the high specific surface area of the reduced graphene oxide, which enhanced the electronic conductivity and ion mobility. The fiber electrode not only exhibits good mechanical performance, but also has excellent electrochemical properties. Equally importantly, the method is simple and efficient, and the working environment is flexible. It can precisely control the shape, size and structure of the one-dimensional fiber flexible electrode, which is of great significance for the development of future flexible electronic devices.

Hybrid electrolytes comprising flexible polymers and highly conductive inorganic electrolytes must be compatible with soft thin films with high ionic conductivity. Herein, we propose a new type of solid electrolyte hybrid comprising a glass–ceramic inorganic electrolyte powder (Li 1+ x + y Al x Ti 2− x Si y P 3− y O 12 ; LICGC) in a poly(ethylene)oxide (PEO)-based polymer electrolyte that prevents decreases in ionic conductivity caused by grain boundary resistance. We investigated the cross-linking processes taking place in hybrid electrolytes. We also prepared chemically cross-linked PEO/LICGC and physically cross-linked poly(norbornene)/LICGC electrolytes, and evaluated them using thermal and electrochemical analyses, respectively. All of the obtained electrolyte systems were provided with homogenous, white, flexible, and self-standing thin films. The main ionic conductive phase changed from the polymer to the inorganic electrolyte at low temperatures (close to the glass transition temperature) as the LICGC concentration increased, and the Li + ion transport number also improved. Cyclic voltammetry using [Li metal|Ni] cells revealed that Li was reversibly deposited/dissolved in the prepared hybrid electrolytes, which are expected to be used as new Li + -conductive solid electrolyte systems.

Solid-State Lithium Batteries with Cathode-Supported Composite Solid Electrolytes Enabling High-Rate Capability and Excellent Cyclic Performance,"Kang-Feng Chang, Pradeep Kumar Panda, Chien-Te Hsieh, Po-Chih Yang, Navish Kataria, Kuan Shiong Khoo",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9100490,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/10/490/pdf?version=1695783387,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/10/490,14,"In this study, robust composite solid electrolytes were developed and employed to enhance the performance of Li-metal batteries significantly. The robust composite solid electrolytes are composed of a soft polymer, poly(ethylene oxide), a Li salt, bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and super ionic conductive ceramic fillers such as Li 1.5 Al 0.5 Ti 1.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP), and Li 6.4 La 3 Zr 1.4 Ta 0.6 O 12 (LLZTO). The main goal of this study is to enhance the electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity. The ionic conductivities of the composite solid electrolytes were found to be 2.08 × 10 −4 and 1.64 × 10 −4 S cm −1 with the introduction of LATP and LLZTO fillers, respectively. The results prove that the fabricated solid electrolyte was electrochemical stable at voltage exceeding 4.25 V vs. Li/Li + . The internal resistance of the solid electrolyte significantly reduced compared to gel electrolyte. This reduction can be attributed to the alleviation of bulk electrolyte, charge-transfer, and interfacial electrolyte/electrode impedance. When LiFePO 4 cathode sheets are coated with a composite solid electrolyte containing LATP powders, the resulting Li-metal battery displays high capacity at 5 C (with a capacity retention of 65.2% compared to the original capacity at 0.2 C) as well as superior cyclic stability and excellent Coulombic efficiency (>99.5%, 200 cycles). These results confirm that the composite solid electrolyte acts as a protective layer which has the ability to prevent the growth of Li dendrites. Consequently, the fabricated electrolyte configuration can be engineered to enable high energy/power density and electrochemical stable cyclability in Li-metal batteries. Full article"

Even after 100 years, the model still poses challenges and is the subject of active research. In this work, we address the question of whether it is possible to describe the free energy A of a finite-size 2D-Ising model of arbitrary size, based on a couple of analytically solvable 1D-Ising chains. The presented novel approach is based on rigorous statistical-thermodynamic principles and involves modeling the free energy contribution of an added inter-chain bond Δ A bond ( β , N ) as function of inverse temperature β and lattice size N . The identified simple analytic expression for Δ A bond is fitted to exact results of a series of finite-size quadratic N × N -systems and enables straightforward and instantaneous calculation of thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as free energy and heat capacity for systems of an arbitrary size. This approach is not only interesting from a fundamental perspective with respect to the possible transfer to a 3D-Ising model, but also from an application-driven viewpoint in the context of (Li-ion) batteries where it could be applied to describe intercalation mechanisms.

Mixing two or more polymers (blends) together or compositing the polymers with inorganic compounds/carbon-based nanomaterials greatly solved the problem associated with the mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties along with the chemical stability, which paves a new pathway for optimizing the functional properties of active materials. However, a mere mixing of individual components sometimes would not provide enhanced properties due to the formation of phase-separated, larger domains of components. In particular, the grain boundaries of components, also known as “interfaces”, actually determine the properties of these composite materials. The tuning of interfacial properties is significant to achieve composites with higher electrical conductivity and better charge transfer kinetics if they are targeted toward high-performance energy devices. This review aims to provide an overview of recent advancements in the area of polymeric composite materials with tuned interfacial characteristics towards energy conversion (solar cells, photocatalytic hydrogen production, and nanogenerators) and energy storage (supercapacitors and metal-ion batteries) devices with very recent representative examples.

In this work, a wet impregnation process was utilized to convert the detrimental Li 2 CO 3 and LiOH impurities into a beneficial functional surface coating comprising phosphates. Specifically, hydro-phosphates were used as the functional surface modification agents to mitigate the detrimental effect of surface residuals. The best electrochemical performance was achieved by modifying LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 with a diluted dihydro-phosphate solution (pKa = 7.2), while the metal cation had a negligible impact on the electrochemical performance.

This is problematic for renewable generators due to their fluctuating output. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) integrated with renewable sources in a hybrid farm (HF) can alleviate imbalances and increase power system flexibility.

This study evaluates the state-of-the-art on energy management systems (EMS) for HFs participating in day-ahead and intraday markets, incorporating both BESSs’ calendar and cycling degradation. Results suggest that efforts to attain additional profits in intraday markets can be detrimental, especially when the degradation effect is considered in the analysis.

Nevertheless, the limited catalytic kinetics, along with the scarcity of noble metals, still hinder the practical applications of ZABs. Consequently, it is of great importance to explore efficient bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts with abundant reserves. Although iron oxides are considered to have some of the greatest potential as catalysts among the metal oxides, owing to their excellent redox properties, lower toxicity, simple preparation, and natural abundance, their poor electrical conductivity and high agglomeration still limit their development.

To commercialize direct liquid cooling for battery thermal management, an extensive database reflecting performance and operating parameters needs to be established. The development of prediction models could generate this reference database to design an effective cooling system with the least experimental effort. In the present work, artificial neural network (ANN) modeling is demonstrated to predict the thermal and electrical performances of batteries with direct oil cooling based on various operating conditions. The experiments are conducted on an 18650 battery module with direct oil cooling to generate the learning data for the development of neural network models. The neural network models are developed considering oil temperature, oil flow rate, and discharge rate as the input operating conditions and maximum temperature, temperature difference, heat transfer coefficient, and voltage as the output thermal and electrical performances. The proposed neural network models comprise two algorithms, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) training variant with the Tangential-Sigmoidal (Tan-Sig) transfer function and that with the Logarithmic-Sigmoidal (Log-Sig) transfer function. The ANN_LM-Tan algorithm with a structure of 3-10-10-4 shows accurate prediction of thermal and electrical performances under all operating conditions compared to the ANN_LM-Log algorithm with the same structure. The maximum prediction errors for the ANN_LM-Tan and ANN_LM-Log algorithms are restricted within ±0.97% and ±4.81%, respectively, considering all input and output parameters.

Reliable modeling and simulations of new active materials for lithium-ion batteries are becoming more and more important, especially regarding cost-efficient cell design. Because literature lacks an electrochemical model for silicon-dominant electrodes, this work aims to close the gap. To this end, a Newman p2D model for a lithium-ion cell with a silicon-dominant anode and a nickel-cobalt-aluminum-oxide cathode is parametrized. The micrometer silicon particles are partially lithiated to 1200 mAh g − 1 Si g Si − 1 . The parametrization is based on values from the electrode manufacturing process, measured values using lab cells, and literature data. Charge and discharge tests at six different C-rates up to 2C serve as validation data, showing a root-mean-squared error of about 21 mV and a deviation in discharge capacity of about 1.3%, both during a 1 C constant current discharge. Overall, a validated parametrization for a silicon-dominant anode is presented, which, to the best of our knowledge, is not yet available in literature. For future work, more in-depth studies should investigate the material parameters for silicon to expand the data available in the literature and facilitate further simulation work. Full article"

They influence a number of key dispersion characteristics and battery parameters. In the light of growing interest in additive manufacturing technologies, binders were found to decisively govern the processability due to the induced complex non-Newtonian behavior. This paper examines the relevance of various binder derivatives for aqueous graphite dispersions that can be employed in inkjet printing. Two different carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) derivatives with strongly deviating molecular weights were employed. The impact of the inherent polymer characteristics on the processability and the electrode characteristics were explored. Therefore, miscellaneous studies were carried out at the dispersion, the electrode, and the cell levels. The results revealed that the CMC with the lower molecular weight affected most of the studied characteristics more favorably than the counterpart with a higher molecular weight. In particular, the processability, encompassing drop formation and drop deposition, the cohesion behavior, and the electrochemical characteristics, were positively impacted by the low-molecular-weight CMC. The adhesion behavior was enhanced using the high-molecular-weight CMC. This demonstrates that the selection of a suitable binder derivative merits close attention. Full article"

The hydroxyl group of PVA and the carboxyl group of CA were crosslinked under the heat treatment, resulting in a slight reduction in the porosity and pore size of the composite separator compared to pure PVA, and to compensate for this issue, the mechanical strengths, as well as the thermal dimensional stability of the PVA/CA-H separator, were significantly improved. Meanwhile, the PVA/CA-H separator exhibited good electrolyte uptake (158.1%) and high ionic conductivity (1.63 mS cm −1 ), and, thus, the battery assembled with the PVA/CA-H separator exhibited a capacity retention of 96.3% after 150 cycles at 1 C. These features mean that the crosslinked PVA composite separator can be considered as a prospective high-safety and high-performance separator for LIBs. Full article"

Lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) is considered a promising solid electrolyte due to its safe operating potential window (0–5 V) combined with its good electrochemical stability. In this work, 250 g batches of pre-sintered Ta-doped LLZO (Li 7 La 3 Zr 1.6 Ta 0.4 O 12 , Ta-LLZO) were synthesized for bulk production of a dense LLZO electrolyte. A simple two-step thermal treatment process was developed. The first thermal step at 950 °C initiates nucleation of LLZO, with carefully controlled process parameters such as heating atmosphere, temperature, and dopant concentration. In the second thermal step at 1150 °C, sintered discs were obtained as solid electrolytes, with relative densities of 96%. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the phase purity of the sintered Ta-LLZO disc, and refined data were used to calculate the lattice parameter (12.944 Å). Furthermore, the presence of the Ta dopant in the disc was confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The ionic and electronic conductivity values of the Ta-LLZO disc were 10 −4 S cm −1 and 10 −10 S cm −1 , respectively. These values confirm that the prepared (Ta-LLZO) discs exhibit ionic conductivity while being electronically insulating, being suitable for use as solid electrolytes with the requisite electrical properties.

Understanding the causes and probabilities of failures in a 12 V power supply is crucial. Field analyses of aged and failed 12 V lead batteries can provide valuable insights regarding this topic. In a previous study, non-invasive electrical testing was used to objectively determine the reasons for failure and the lifetime of individual batteries. By identifying all of the potential failure mechanisms, the Latin hypercube sampling method was found to effectively reduce the required sample size. To ensure sufficient confidence in validating diagnostic algorithms and calculating time-dependent failure rates, all identified aging phenomena must be considered. This study presents a probability distribution of the failure mechanisms that occur in the field, as well as provides insights into potential opportunities, but it also challenges diagnostic approaches for current and future vehicles.

Experimental Investigation of Thermal Runaway Propagation in a Lithium-Ion Battery Pack: Effects of State of Charge and Coolant Flow Rate,"Wanyi Wu, Qiaomin Ke, Jian Guo, Yiwei Wang, Yishu Qiu, Jiwen Cen, Fangming Jiang",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9110552,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/552/pdf?version=1699783335,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/552,3,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used as power sources for electric vehicles due to their various advantages, including high energy density and low self-discharge rate. However, the safety challenges associated with LIB thermal runaway (TR) still need to be addressed. In the present study, the effects of the battery SOC value and coolant flow rate on the TR behavior in a LIB pack are comprehensively investigated. The battery pack consists of 10 18650-type LIBs applied with the serpentine channel liquid-cooling thermal management system (TMS). The TR tests for various SOC values (50%, 75% and 100%) and coolant flow rates (0 L/h, 32 L/h, 64 L/h and 96 L/h) are analyzed. The retarding effect of the TMS on TR propagation is found to be correlated with both the coolant flow rate and the battery SOC value, and a larger coolant flow rate and lower SOC generally result in fewer TR batteries. Furthermore, the TR propagation rate, evaluated by the time interval of TR occurrence between the adjacent batteries, increases with the battery SOC. The battery pack with 100% SOC shows more rapid TR propagation, which can be completed in just a few seconds, in contrast to several minutes for 50% and 75% SOC cases. In addition, the impact of the battery SOC and coolant flow rate on the maximum temperature of the TR battery is also examined, and no determined association is observed between them. However, it is found that the upstream batteries (closer to the external heater) show a slightly higher maximum temperature than the downstream ones, indicating a weak association between the TR battery maximum temperature and the external heating duration or the battery temperature at which the TR starts to take place.

Bi-Continuous Si/C Anode Materials Derived from Silica Aerogels for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Yunpeng Shan, Junzhang Wang, Zhou Xu, Shengchi Bai, Yingting Zhu, Xiaoqi Wang, Xingzhong Guo",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9110551,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/551/pdf?version=1699595401,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/551,7,"Poor cycling performance caused by massive volume expansion of silicon (Si) has always hindered the widespread application of silicon-based anode materials. Herein, bi-continuous silicon/carbon (Si/C) anode materials are prepared via magnesiothermic reduction of silica aerogels followed by pitch impregnation and carbonization. To fabricate the expected bi-continuous structure, mesoporous silica aerogel is selected as the raw material for magnesiothermic reduction. It is successfully reduced to mesoporous Si under the protection of NaCl. The as-obtained mesoporous Si is then injected with molten pitch via vacuuming, and the pitch is subsequently converted into carbon at a high temperature. The innovative point of this strategy is the construction of a bi-continuous structure, which features both Si and carbon with a cross-linked structure, which provides an area to accommodate the colossal volume change of Si. The pitch-derived carbon facilitates fast lithium ion transfer, thereby increasing the conductivity of the Si/C anode. It can also diminish direct contact between Si and the electrolyte, minimizing side reactions between them. The obtained bi-continuous Si/C anodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1481.7 mAh g −1 at a current density of 300 mA g −1 and retaining as 813.5 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles and an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 82%.

The radial fiber structure can lower the activation energy and minimize the distance of the Li + diffusion, while the highly conductive cross-linked network within the fibers benefits the speed up charge transmission. Thus, the as-synthesized graphite fibers demonstrate superior rate capability and cycle stability. GFs exhibit a capacity retention rate of 97.94% and reversible capacity of 327.8 mA h g −1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, which is higher than that of natural graphite anode materials (85.66% and 289.7 mA h g −1 , respectively).

Separation and recovery of critical metals (Co, Ni, Li, and Mn) from other metal impurities must yield purified metal salts, while avoiding substantial losses of critical metals. Solvent extraction in batch experiments were conducted using mixed metal sulphates obtained from the leach liquor obtained from spent and shredded lithium-ion batteries. Selective extraction of Mn 2+ , Fe 3+ , Al 3+ and Cu 2+ from simulated and real leached mixed metals solution was carried out using di-2-ethylhexylphophoric acid (D2EPHA) and Cyanex-272 at varying pH. Further experiments with the preferred extractant (D2EPHA) were performed under different conditions: changing the concentration of extractant, organic to aqueous ratio, and varying the diluents. At optimum conditions (40% v / v D2EPHA in kerosene, pH 2.5, O:A = 1:1, 25 °C, and 20 min), 85% Mn 2+ , 98% Al 3+ , 100% Fe 3+ , and 43% Cu 2+ were extracted with losses of only trace amounts (<5.0%) of Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , and Li + . The order of extraction efficiency for the diluents was found to be kerosene > Exxal-10 >>> dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2 ) > toluene. Four stages of stripping of metals loaded on D2EPHA were performed as co-extracted metal impurities were selectively stripped, and a purified MnSO 4 solution was produced.

Currently, SOH research is largely based on laboratory data, with a dearth of research on electric vehicle (EV) operating data. Due to the difficulty in obtaining complete charge data under EV operating conditions, this study presents a SOH estimation method utilizing deep network adaptation. First, a data-driven approach is employed to extract voltage, current, state of charge (SOC), and incremental capacity (IC) data features. To compensate for the lack of aging information in the EV operation data domain, transfer learning is employed to construct the SOH estimation model. Additionally, to resolve inconsistent data distribution between the source laboratory battery data domain and the target EV operation data domain, an adaptive layer is added to the network, and adaptation of deep network (ADN) is utilized to enhance the model’s performance. Finally, the model is validated using electric bus operational data. Results indicate that this model’s average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is less than 3.0%, and, compared to support vector machine (SVM) regression and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms, the MAE is reduced by 27.7% and 38.4%, respectively.

However, it is important to note that they may pose safety risks, including the potential for explosions during use. Therefore, achieving stable and safe utilization of these batteries necessitates accurate state-of-charge (SOC) estimation. In this study, we propose a hybrid model combining temporal convolutional network (TCN) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to investigate the nonlinear and evolving characteristics of batteries. The primary goal is to enhance SOC estimation performance by leveraging TCN’s long-effective memory capabilities and XGBoost’s robust generalization abilities. We conducted experiments using datasets from NASA, Oxford, and a vehicle simulator to validate the model’s performance. Additionally, we compared the performance of our model with that of a multilayer neural network, long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, XGBoost, and TCN.

For oxide-based SSBs, the co-sintering of a composite cathode is one of the main challenges. High process temperatures cause undesired decomposition reactions of the active material and the solid electrolyte. The formed phases inhibit the high energy and power density of ceramic SSBs. Therefore, the selection of suitable material combinations as well as the reduction of the sintering temperatures are crucial milestones in the development of ceramic SSBs. In this work, the co-sintering behavior of Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP) as a solid electrolyte with Li-ion conductivity of ≥0.38 mS/cm and LiFePO 4 with a C-coating (LFP) as a Li-ion storage material (active material) is investigated. The shrinkage behavior, crystallographic analysis and microstructural changes during co-sintering at temperatures between 650 and 850 °C are characterized in a simplified model system by mixing, pressing and sintering the LATP and LFP and compared with tape-casted composite cathodes (d = 55 µm). The tape-casted and sintered composite cathodes were infiltrated by liquid electrolyte as well as polyethylene oxide (PEO) electrolyte and electrochemically characterized as half cells against a Li metal anode. The results indicate the formation of reaction layers between LATP and LFP during co-sintering. At T s > 750 °C, the rhombohedral LATP phase is transformed into an orthorhombic Li 1.3+x Al 0.3−y Fe x+y Ti 1.7−x (PO 4 ) 3 (LAFTP) phase. During co-sintering, Fe 3+ diffuses into the LATP phase and partially occupies the Al 3+ and Ti 4+ sites of the NASICON structure. The formation of this LAFTP leads to significant changes in the electrochemical properties of the infiltrated composite tapes. Nevertheless, a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g −1 is measured by infiltrating the sintered composite tapes with liquid electrolytes. Additionally, infiltration with a PEO electrolyte leads to a capacity of 125 mAh g −1 . Therefore, the material combination of LATP and LFP is a promising approach to realize sintered ceramic SSBs.

However, the state of such batteries in terms of aging and safety remains uncertain when they enter the second-life market. The aging mechanisms within these batteries involve a combination of processes, impacting their safety and performance. Presently, direct health indicators (HIs) like state of health (SOH) and internal resistance increase are utilized to assess battery aging, but they do not always provide accurate indications of the battery’s health state. This study focuses on analyzing various HIs obtained through a basic charging–discharging cycle and assessing their sensitivity to aging. Commercial 50 Ah pouch cells with different aging histories were tested, and the HIs were evaluated. Thirteen HIs out of 31 proved to be highly aging-sensitive, and thus good indicators. Namely, SOH upon charging and discharging, Coulombic efficiency, constant current discharge time, voltage relaxation profile trend, voltage–charge area upon discharging, hysteresis open circuit voltage HIs, and temperature difference between the tabs upon charging. The findings offer valuable insights for developing robust qualification algorithms and reliable battery health monitoring systems for second-life batteries, ensuring safe and efficient battery operation in diverse second-life applications.

Their ability to resist loads depends upon the properties of the materials they are made from and how they are constructed and loaded. Here, prismatic lithium-ion battery cell components were mechanically and optically characterized to examine details of material morphology, construction, and mechanical loading response. Tensile tests were conducted on the cell case enclosure, anodes, cathodes, and separators. Compression tests on stacks of anodes, cathodes, separators, and jellyrolls were made from them. Substantially differing behaviors were observed amongst all components tested. An optical examination of the anodes, cathodes, and separators revealed homogeneities, anisotropies, and defects. Substantial texturing was present parallel to the winding direction. When highly compressed, jellyrolls develop well-defined V-shaped cracks aligned parallel to the texturing. Like many laminates, altering the lay-up construction affects jellyroll mechanical performance. To demonstrate, a cross-ply jellyroll was fabricated by rotating every other complete component set (cathode/separator/anode/separator), reassembling, and compressing. A distinctly different fracture pattern and increased compressive strength were observed. Full article"

The results elucidated that when the flow rate in the cooling plate increased from 2 to 6 L/min, the average temperature of the battery module decreased from 53.8 to 50.7 °C, but the pumping power increased from 0.036 to 0.808 W. In addition, an increase in the width of the cooling channel and number of channels resulted in a decrease in the average temperature of the battery module and a reduction in the pumping power. The most influential variable for the temperature control of the battery was an increase in the flow rate. In addition, according to the results of the orthogonal analysis, an increase in the number of cooling plate channels resulted in the best cooling performance and reduced pumping power. Based on this, a cooling plate with six channels was applied to both the top and bottom parts, and the top and bottom cooling showed sufficient cooling performance in maintaining the average temperature of the battery module below 45 °C.

State of Health Assessment of Spent Lithium–Ion Batteries Based on Voltage Integral during the Constant Current Charge,"Ote Amuta, Julia Kowal",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9110537,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/537/pdf?version=1698731995,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/537,5,"Lithium–ion batteries (LIBs) are used in many personal electronic devices (PED) and energy-demanding applications such as electric vehicles. After their first use, rather than dispose of them for recycling, some may still have reasonable capacity and can be used in secondary applications. The current test methods to assess them are either slow, complex or expensive. The voltage integral during the constant current (CC) charge of the same model of LIBs strongly correlates with the state of health (SOH) and is faster than a full capacity check. Compared to the filtering requirement in the incremental capacity (IC) and differential voltage (DV) or the complex analysis in the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS), the voltage integral offers a simple integration method, just like the simple capacity Coulomb’s counter that is installed in many BMS for estimating the SOC of LIBs. By obtaining the voltage integral of a relatively new cell and an old cell of the same model with known SOH at a given ambient temperature and CC charge, the SOH of other similar cells can be easily estimated by finding their voltage integrals.

However, the technology’s high energy consumption has also been noted as a challenge in this recovery process. Recently, an innovative and sustainable approach using microwave (MW) radiation has been proposed as an alternative to traditional pyrometallurgical methods for treating used lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). This method aims to address the shortcomings of the conventional approach. In this study, the treatment of the black mass (BM) from spent LCO batteries is explored for the first time using MW–materials interaction under an air atmosphere. The research reveals that the process can trigger carbothermic reactions. However, MW makes the BM so reactive that it causes rapid heating of the sample in a few minutes, also posing a fire risk. This paper presents and discusses the benefits and potential hazards associated with this novel technology for the recovery of spent LCO batteries and gives information about real samples of BM. The work opens the possibility of using a microwave for raw material recovery in spent LIBs, allowing to obtain rapid and more efficient reactions. Full article"

The main advantages offered by printing technologies are flexibility, customizability, easy production, large area, and high scalability. Among the printing techniques, gravure is the most appealing for the industrial manufacture of functional layers thanks to its characteristics of high quality and high speed. To date, despite its advantages, such technology has been little investigated, especially in the field of energy since it is difficult to obtain functionality and adequate mass loading using diluted inks. In this review, the recent results for printed lithium-ion batteries are reported and discussed. A methodology for controlling the ink formulation and process based on the capillary number was proposed to obtain high printing quality and layer functionality. Specific concerns were found to play a fundamental role for each specific material and its performance when used as a film. Considering all such issues, gravure can provide high performance layers. A multilayer approach enables the desired layer mass loading to be achieved with advantages in terms of bulk homogeneity. Such results can boost the future industrial employment of gravure printing in the field of printed batteries. Full article"

However, equivalent negative electrode materials for complementary sodium ion battery (NIB) technologies are yet to be commercialized due to sluggish reaction kinetics, phase instability, and low energy density originating from the larger size of Na + -ion. Therefore, in search of the next-generation electrode materials for NIBs, we first analyze the failure of graphite during reversible Na + ion storage. Building upon that, we suggest surface-functionalized and nanostructured forms of analogous carbon allotropes for enhancing Na+ ion storage. During long-term rigorous cycling conditions, Graphene Oxide (GO) and Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) exhibit higher Na + ion storage (157 mAh g −1 and 50 mAh g −1 after 60 cycles, respectively) compared to graphite (27 mAh g −1 ). Optimizing alternative NIBs requires a comprehensive analysis of cycling behavior and kinetic information. Therefore, in this investigation, we further examine ex-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at progressive cycles and correlate capacity degradation with impedance arising from the electrolyte, solid electrolyte interphase formation, and charge transfer.

However, an indispensable critical component in LiC is the capacitive cathode for high power. Activated carbon (AC) is typically the cathode material due to its low cost, abundant raw material for production, sustainability, easily tunable properties, and scalability. However, compared to conventional battery-type cathodes, the low capacity of AC remains a limiting factor for improving the specific energy of LiC to match the battery counterparts.

Hence, solid-state sodium metal batteries, which employ inorganic solid electrolytes and/or solid-state polymer electrolytes, are considered an emerging technology for addressing the safety hazards. Unfortunately, these traditional inorganic/polymer solid electrolytes, most of which are prepared via ex-situ methods, frequently suffer from inadequate ionic conductivity and sluggish interfacial transportation. In light of this, in-situ polymerized solid-state polymer electrolytes are proposed to simplify their preparation process and simultaneously address these aforementioned challenges. In this review, the up-to-date research progress of the design, synthesis, and applications of this kind of polymer electrolytes for sodium batteries of high safety via several in-situ polymerization methods (including photoinduced in-situ polymerization, thermally induced in-situ free radical polymerization, in-situ cationic polymerization, and cross-linking reaction) are summarized.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur/Li 2 S and the rapid capacity fading due to the shuttle effect have hindered their commercialization. In this study, we propose a method to boost the performance of lithium–sulfur batteries by modifying the sulfur cathode with a coating layer composed of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and Super P conductive carbon. The PEI/Super P-modified electrode retained 73% of its discharge capacity after 300 cycles at the 2 C scan rate. The PEI/Super P coated layer effectively adsorbs lithium polysulfides, suppressing the shuttle effect and acting as an auxiliary electrode to facilitate the electrochemical reactions of sulfur/Li 2 S. We analyzed the PEI/Super P-modified electrodes using symmetric cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The battery manufacturing method presented here is not only cost-effective but also industrially viable due to its compatibility with the roll-to-roll process. Full article"

The electrolytes consist of a 1:1 ( v : v ) mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC), a sodium-conducting salt (either NaPF 6 or NaTFSI), and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), respectively, sodium difluoro(oxalato) borate (NaDFOB), as additives. Through systematic evaluation using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we analyze the formation of degradation products under different conditions including variations in temperature, vial material, and the presence or absence of sodium metal. Our results reveal the significant influence of the conductive salt’s source on degradation. Furthermore, we observe that FEC’s stability is affected by the storage temperature, vial material, and presence of sodium metal, suggesting its active involvement in the degradation process. Additionally, our results highlight the role of NaDFOB as an additive in mitigating degradation. The study provides crucial insights into the complex network of degradation reactions occurring within the electrolyte, thus informing strategies for improved electrolyte systems in sodium-based batteries. Since the production, material selection and storage of electrolytes are often insufficiently described, we provide here an insight into the different behavior of electrolytes for Na-ion batteries.

This study found that the largest percentage of polarization is ohmic polarization, followed by concentration polarization and electrochemical polarization. The values of the three types of polarization are generally small and stable under normal-temperature environments and low discharge rates. However, they increase significantly in low-temperature environments and at high discharge rates and continue to rise during the discharge process. Additionally, ohmic heat generation and polarization generation also increase significantly under these conditions. Reversible entropy heat is less sensitive to ambient temperature but increases significantly with the increase in the discharge rate. Ohmic heat generation and polarization heat generation contribute to the total heat generation of the battery at any ambient temperature, while reversible entropy heat only contributes to the total heat generation of the battery at the end of discharge.

Electrolyte Optimization to Improve the High-Voltage Operation of Single-Crystal LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2in Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Wengao Zhao, Mayan Si, Kuan Wang, Enzo Brack, Ziyan Zhang, Xinming Fan, Corsin Battaglia",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9110528,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/528/pdf?version=1698217942,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/11/528,5,"Single-crystal Ni-rich layered oxide materials LiNi 1−x−y Co x Mn y O 2 (NCM, 1 – x − y ≥ 0.6) are emerging as promising cathode materials that do not show intergranular cracks as a result of the lack of grain boundaries and anisotropy of the bulk structure, enabling extended cyclability in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) operating at high voltage. However, SC-NCM materials still suffer from capacity fading upon extended cycling. This degradation of capacity can be attributed to a reconstruction of the surface. A phase transformation from layered structures to disordered spinel/rock-salt structures was found to be responsible for impedance growth and capacity loss. Film-forming additives are a straightforward approach for the mitigation of surface reconstruction via the formation of a robust protection layer at the cathode’s surface. In this work, we investigate various additives on the electrochemical performance of single-crystal LiNi 0.83 Co 0.11 Mn 0.06 O 2 (SC-NCM83). The results demonstrate that the use of 1% lithium difluoroxalate borate (LiDFOB) and 1% lithium difluorophosphate (LiPO 2 F 2 ) additives substantially enhanced the cycling performance (with a capacity retention of 93.6% after 150 cycles) and rate capability in comparison to the baseline electrolyte (72.7%) as well as electrolytes using 1% LiDFOB (90.5%) or 1% LiPO 2 F 2 (88.3%) individually. The superior cycling stability of the cell using the combination of both additives was attributed to the formation of a conformal cathode/electrolyte interface (CEI) layer, resulting in a stabilized bulk structure and decreased impedance upon long-term cycling, as evidenced via a combination of state-of-the-art analytical techniques.

A framework for analyzing the performance of a grid-integrated electrolyzer-ESS system is developed, taking into account realistic scenarios and accurate models. The system components consist of a 500 kW alkaline electrolyzer module integrated with a medium-voltage grid and three different commercially available ESSs based on Li-ion battery, Li-ion capacitor, and supercapacitor technology, respectively. The performance of these ESSs is extensively studied for three LVRT profiles, with a primary focus on the upcoming Danish grid code. In order to perform simulation studies, the system is implemented on the MATLAB ® /Simulink ® -PLECS ® platform. The results demonstrate that all three energy storage technologies are capable of supporting the electrolyzer systems during low-voltage abnormalities in the distribution grid. The study also reveals that the supercapacitor-based technology seems to be more appropriate, from a techno-economic perspective, for fault ride-through (FRT) compliance. Full article"

However, this polycrystalline ceramic electrolyte contains an abundance of grain boundaries (GBs). During the repetitive electroplating and stripping of Li ions, uncontrolled growth and spreading of lithium dendrites often occur at GBs, posing safety concerns and resulting in a shortened cycle life. Reducing the formation and growth of lithium dendrites can be achieved by rational grain boundary design. Herein, the garnet-type solid electrolyte LLZTO was firstly coated with Al 2 O 3 using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. Subsequently, an annealing treatment was employed to introduce Al 2 O 3 into grain boundaries, effectively modifying them. Compared with the Li/LLZTO/Li cells, the Li/LLZTO@Al 2 O 3 -annealed/Li symmetric batteries exhibit a more stable cycling performance with an extended period of 200 h at 1 mA cm −2 . After matching with the NMC811 cathode, the capacity retention rate of batteries can reach 96.8% after 50 cycles. The infusion of Al 2 O 3 demonstrates its capability to react with LLZTO particles, creating an ion-conducting interfacial layer of Li-Al-O at the GBs. This interfacial layer effectively inhibits Li nucleation and filament growth within LLZTO, contributing to the suppression of lithium dendrites. Our work provides new suggestions for optimizing the synthesis of solid-state electrolytes, which can help facilitate the commercial application of solid-state batteries. Full article"

However, poor cycle lifetimes and coulombic efficiencies (CEs) due to detrimental lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling has hindered its widespread adoption. To address this challenge, a modified sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) polymer with integrated dopamine moieties and polydopamine nanoparticles was created through a facile one-pot dopamine (DOP) amidation reaction to strengthen noncovalent interactions with LiPSs and mitigate the shuttling effect. The resulting CMC-DOP binder improved electrode wettability, adhesion, and electrochemical performance. Compared to LSBs with a standard CMC binder, CMC-DOP 5:1 (with a 5:1 weight ratio of CMC to dopamine precursor) improves the specific capacity at cycle 100 by 38% to 552 mAh g −1 and CE from 96.8 to 98.9%. LSBs show good stability, even after 500 cycles. Post-mortem electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) studies confirmed the effectiveness of the CMC-DOP in confining LiPS in the cathode. This simple but effective nature-inspired strategy promises to enhance the viability of LSBs without using harmful chemicals or adding excess bulk. Full article"

All active material (AAM) electrodes provide a route to achieve both of those aims toward high areal capacity electrodes. AAM electrodes are often fabricated using hydraulic compression processes followed by thermal treatment; however, additive manufacturing routes could provide opportunities for more time-efficient and geometry-flexible electrode fabrication. One possible route for additive manufacturing of AAM electrodes would be to employ plasma spray as a direct additive manufacturing technology, and AAM electrode fabrication using plasma spray will be the focus of the work herein. TiO 2 and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) powders were deposited onto stainless steel substrates via plasma spray processing to produce AAM battery electrodes, and evaluated with regards to material and electrochemical properties. The TiO 2 electrodes delivered low electrochemical capacity, <12 mAh g −1 , which was attributed to limitations of the initial feed powder. LTO plasma sprayed AAM electrodes had much higher capacity and were comparable in total capacity at a low rate of discharge to composite electrodes fabricated using the same raw powder feed material. LTO material and electrochemical properties were sensitive to the plasma spray conditions, suggesting that tuning the material microstructure and electrochemical properties is possible by controlling the plasma spray deposition parameters.

Principal effects include the potential loss of the charge–discharge synchronization and the subsequent impact on the control stabilization, the increased degradation in batteries’ health/life, and resultant power- and energy-efficiency losses. This paper proposes and tests a candidate solution to compensate for the infrastructure effects in a DC microgrid with a varying number of heterogeneous battery storage systems in the context of a multiagent neighbor-to-neighbor control scheme. Specifically, the scheme regulates the balance of the batteries’ load-demand participation, with adaptive compensation for unknown and/or time-varying DC infrastructure influences. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop studies in realistic conditions demonstrate the improved precision of the charge–discharge synchronization and the enhanced balance of the output voltage under 24 h excessively continuous variations in the load demand. In addition, immediate real-time compensation for the DC infrastructure influence can be attained with no need for initial estimates of key unknown parameters. The results provide both the validation and verification of the proposals under real operational conditions and expectations, including the dynamic switching of the heterogeneous batteries’ connection (plug-and-play) and the variable infrastructure influences of different dynamically switched branches. Key observed metrics include an average reduced convergence time (0.66–13.366%), enhanced output-voltage balance (2.637–3.24%), power-consumption reduction (3.569–4.93%), and power-flow-balance enhancement (2.755–6.468%), which can be achieved for the proposed scheme over a baseline for the experiments in question.

However, the phenomenon of capacity recovery (CR) may impede the progress of improving battery capacity prediction performance. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the phenomenon of capacity recovery during battery degradation and propose a hybrid lithium-ion battery capacity prediction framework based on two states. First, to improve the density of capacity-related information, the simultaneous Markov blanket discovery algorithm (STMB) is used to screen the causal features of capacity from the initial feature set. Then, the life-long cycle sequence of batteries is partitioned into global degradation regions and recovery regions, as part of the proposed prediction framework. The prediction branch for the global degradation region is implemented through a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and the other prediction branch for the recovery region is implemented through Gaussian process regression (GPR). A support vector machine (SVM) model is applied to identify recovery points to switch the branch of the prediction framework. The prediction results are integrated to obtain the final prediction results. Experimental studies based on NASA’s lithium battery aging data highlight the trustworthy capacity prediction ability of the proposed method considering the capacity recovery phenomenon. In contrast to the comparative methods, the mean absolute error and the root mean square error are reduced by up to 0.0013 Ah and 0.0043 Ah, which confirms the validity of the proposed method.

It is well known that low-surface-area carbon additives added to the composite cathode enhance the rate capability; however, at the same time, they can lead to rapid decomposition of the solid electrolyte in thiophosphate-based cells. Thus, the fraction of such conductive additives has to be well balanced. Within this study we determined the electronic percolation threshold of a conducting matrix consisting of Li 6 PS 5 Cl and C65. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the microstructure and effective conductivity (σ eff ) of the conducting matrix. The percolation threshold p c was determined as ~4 wt.-% C65, and it is suggested that below p c , the ionic contribution is dominant, which can be seen in temperature-dependent σ eff and blocked charge transport at low frequencies. Above p c , the impedance of the conducting matrix becomes frequency-independent, and the ohmic law applies. Thus, the conducting matrix in ASSB can be regarded as an electronic and ionic conducting phase between active material particles. Additionally, guidelines are provided to enable electronic conduction in the conducting matrix with minimal C65 content. Full article"

Herein, a N, O co-doped carbon nanotube (N, O-CNT) decorated wood framework (WF), denoted as WF-CNT, was designed as a free-standing sulfur host, achieving high sulfur loading of 10 mg s cm −2 . This unique cathode featured low tortuosity microchannels and a conductive framework, reducing the diffusion paths for both ions and electrons and accommodating the volume changes associated with sulfur. Moreover, the internal CNT forests effectively captured soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their redox kinetic. Consequently, the S@WF-CNT-800 sample exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1438.2 mAh g −1 at a high current density of 0.5 A g −1 . Furthermore, a reversible capacity of 404.5 mAh g −1 was obtained after 500 cycles with sulfur loading of 5 mg s cm −2 at 0.5 A g −1 . This work may support the development of high sulfur loading cathodes utilizing cost-effective and sustainable biomass materials for Li-S batteries. Full article"
Qualitative Characterization of Lead–Acid Batteries Fabricated Using Different Technological Procedures: An EIS Approach,"Olivia Bruj, Adrian Calborean",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9120593,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/593/pdf?version=1702626769,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/593,,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques were applied in this work to nine industrially fabricated lead–acid battery prototypes, which were divided into three type/technology packages. Frequency-dependent impedance changes were interpreted during successive charge/discharge cycles in two distinct stages: (1) immediately after fabrication and (2) after a controlled aging procedure to 50% depth of discharge following industrial standards. To investigate their state of health behavior vs. electrical response, three methods were employed, namely, the Q-Q 0 total charge analysis, the decay values of the constant-phase element in the equivalent Randles circuits, and the resonance frequency of the circuit. A direct correlation was found for the prediction of the best-performing batteries in each package, thus allowing for a qualitative analysis that was capable of providing the decay of the batteries’ states of health. We found which parameters were directly connected with their lifetime performance in both stages and, as a consequence, which type/technology battery prototype displayed the best performance. Based on this methodology, industrial producers can further establish the quality of novel batteries in terms of performance vs. lifespan, allowing them to validate the novel technological innovations implemented in the current prototypes.

To prepare for potential accidents, a study was conducted to select the optimal location for installing an input BESS in terms of frequency stability when the index assumes the backup input of the BESS. This study builds on the premise that installing a BESS on a bus in an area where active power absorption and transmission are the most active can significantly contribute to increasing the frequency recovery of the power system. Based on this premise, the magnitude of the active power flow and the proportional characteristics of the phase difference between buses were mathematically confirmed. This study also calculated the effective power sensitivity index of a bus with 13 FR-ESSs installed in a domestic system and reviewed the frequency output by establishing a table for each failure scenario. The results indicated that the effect of frequency rise can be estimated at the level of tidal current calculation. Thus, the study suggested a direction for subsequent studies to improve the sensitivity index. Full article"

When crafting cathode electrodes for ASSLBs, the solid electrolyte/cathode material interface is physically hindered by the specific morphology of carbon additive materials. In this paper, we examine the distribution of conductive additives within the electrode and its impact on the electrochemical performance of composites incorporating either nano-sized carbon black (CB) or micron-sized carbon nanofibers (CNF) into Ni-rich (LiNi 0 . 8 Co 0 . 1 Mn 0 . 1 O 2 ) cathode material based composites. When nano-sized CB is employed as a conductive additive, it enhances the electrical conductivity of the composite by adopting a uniform distribution. However, its positioning between the solid electrolyte and cathode material leads to an increase in interfacial resistance during charge and discharge cycles, resulting in decreased electrochemical performance. In contrast, using micron-sized CNF as a conductive additive results in a reduction in the composite’s electrical conductivity compared to CB. Nevertheless, due to the comparatively uninterrupted interfaces between the solid electrolyte and cathode materials, it exhibits superior electrochemical characteristics. Our findings are expected to aid the fabrication of electrochemical-enhanced cathode composite electrodes for ASSLBs. Full article"

In the context of recycling, this study addresses the complex challenge of separating black mass of spent LFP batteries from its main composing materials to allow for direct recycling. In this study, 71% copper and 81% aluminium foil impurities were removed by sieving black mass to <250 µm. Next, the application of froth flotation as a separation technique was explored, examining the influence of chemical agents, pre-treatment, and multi-step processes. Frother agent addition improved material recovery in the froth, while collector addition influenced the separation efficiency and enhanced graphite recovery. Pre-treatment, particularly sonication, was found to break down agglomerates and further improve separation. Multi-step flotation increased the purity of recovered fractions. The optimized process for a black mass < 250 µm, involving sonication pre-treatment and double flotation, resulted in enriched carbonaceous material (80.3 mol%) in froth fractions and high LFP concentration (81.9 mol%) in tailings fractions. The recovered spent LFP cathode material contained 37.20 wt% Fe 2 P 2 O 7 , a degradation product of LiFePO 4 .

A Novel Method for State of Health Estimation of Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on Deep Learning Neural Network and Transfer Learning,"Zhong Ren, Changqing Du, Yifang Zhao",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9120585,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/585/pdf?version=1702385110,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/585,6,"Accurate state of health (SOH) estimation of lithium-ion batteries is critical for maintaining reliable and safe working conditions for electric vehicles (EVs). The machine learning-based method with health features (HFs) is encouraging for health prognostics. However, the machine learning method assumes that the training and testing data have the same distribution, which restricts its application for different types of batteries. Thus, in this paper, a deep learning neural network and fine-tuning-based transfer learning strategy are proposed for accurate and robust SOH estimation toward different types of batteries. First, a universal HF extraction strategy is proposed to obtain four highly related HFs. Second, a deep learning neural network consisting of long short-term memory (LSTM) and fully connected layers is established to model the relationship between the HFs and SOH. Third, the fine-tuning-based transfer learning strategy is exploited for SOH estimation of various types of batteries. The proposed methods are comprehensively verified using three open-source datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning neural network with the HFs can estimate the SOH accurately in a single dataset without using the transfer learning strategy where the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are constrained to 1.21% and 1.83%. For the transfer learning between different aging datasets, the overall MAE and RMSE are limited to 1.09% and 1.41%, demonstrating the reliability of the fine-tuning strategy. Full article"

Here, we constructed hierarchical porous NiCoP/NiO nanocomposites anchored on Ni foam with tunable electronic and structural properties, as well as robust interfacial interaction. In NiCoP/NiO, the interconnected NiO nanosheets serve as a carrier with enriched anchoring sites to confine the NiCoP and improve its stability. Meanwhile, the ultrathin NiCoP nanosheets with bimetallic centers are connected with porous NiO nanosheets to form a reliable heterojunction, enhancing the electrochemical reaction kinetics. Taking advantage of the synergistic contribution of bimetallic centers, phosphides and unique structure, the NiCoP/NiO delivers a high areal specific capacitance (1860 mF cm −2 at 5 mA cm −2 ), good rate performance of 78.5% at six times the increased current density, and remarkable durability (11.0% decrease after 10,000 cycles).

To improve the accuracy of SOC estimation, a novel variational extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique based on least square error method is herein provided by establishing a second-order equivalent circuit model for the battery. It was found that when SOC decreased, resistance polarization occurred in the electrochemical model, and the parameters in the equivalent RC model varied. To decrease the modeling error in the equivalent circuit model, the system parameters were identified online depending on the SOC ’s estimated result. Through the SOC -estimation process, the variation theorem was introduced, which enabled the system parameters to track the real situations based on the output measured. The experiment results reveal the comparison of the SOC -estimation results of the variational EKF algorithm, the traditional EKF algorithm, the recursive least square (RLS) EKF algorithm, and the forgotten factor recursive least square (FFRLS) EKF algorithm based on different indices, including the mean square error (MSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE). The variational EKF algorithm provided in this paper has higher estimation accuracy and robustness than the traditional EKF, which verifies the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.

This mechanical degradation behaviour affects the cell’s lifetime by changing the microstructure morphology, altering transport parameters, and active volume losses. Since direct experimental observations of mechanical degradation are challenging, we develop a computer simulation approach that is based on real three-dimensional electrode microstructures. By assuming quasi-static cycling and taking into account the mechanical properties of the electrode’s constituents we calculate the heterogeneous deformation and resulting morphological changes. Additionally, we implement an ageing model that allows us to compute a heterogeneously evolving damage field over multiple cycles. From the damage field, we infer the remaining electrode capacity. Using this technique, an anode blend of graphite particles and silicon carbon composite particles (SiC-C) as well as a cathode consisting of Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Oxide with molar ratio of 8:1:1 (NMC811) are studied. In a two-level homogenization approach, we compute, firstly, the effective mechanical properties of silicon composite particles and, secondly, the whole electrode microstructure. By introducing the damage strain ratio, the degradation evolution of the graphite SiC-C anode blend is studied for up to 95 charge-discharge cycles. With this work, we demonstrate an approach to how mechanical damage of battery electrodes can be treated efficiently. This is the basis for a full coupling to electrochemical simulations.

This work investigated the effects of varying the energy input within the mixing procedure on slurry rheology, coating behavior, mechanical and electrical properties of dry electrodes and electrochemical performance of cells fabricated from these negative electrodes. Energy input differences were achieved by varying the solids content within the mixing procedure; however, the final total solids content of the slurries was always the same. The slurries, produced with graphite and silicon oxide as active materials and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and styrene-butadiene rubber as binders, showed large differences in flow behavior which were explained by changes in CMC adsorption and mechanical degradation because of increasing energy input. Low shear viscosity and the degree of shear thinning decreased with increasing energy input, resulting in a narrower stability window for slot-die coating. The resistance between the electrode and current collector decreased as more CMC was adsorbed on the active material. Electrode adhesion drastically dropped at the highest energy input, presumably due to a change in SBR distribution. Despite these variations, all fabricated pouch cells demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance and a slight trend of increased charge capability was observed in cells prepared with higher energy input.

It has only been over the past ~15 years in which alternate positive electrode materials have been used. As new positive and negative active materials, such as NMC811 and silicon-based electrodes, are being developed, it is crucial to evaluate the potential of these materials at a stack or cell level to fully understand the possible increases in energy density which can be achieved. Comparisons were made between electrode stack volumetric energy densities for designs containing either LCO or NMC811 positive electrode and silicon-graphite negative electrodes, where the weight percentages of silicon were evaluated between zero and ninety percent. Positive electrode areal loadings were evaluated between 2.00 and 5.00 mAh cm −2 . NMC811 at 200 mAh g −1 has the ability to increase stack energy density between 11% and 20% over LCO depending on percentage silicon and areal loading. At a stack level, the percentage of silicon added results in large increases in energy density but delivers a diminishing return, with the greatest increase observed as the percentage of silicon is increased from zero percent to approximately 25–30%.

Mechanochemical degradation processes occur at different scales within an electrode and understanding the correlation between the degradation of mechanical properties, electrochemical aging, and morphological changes is crucial for mitigating battery performance degradation. This paper explores the evolution of mechanical and electrochemical properties at the layer level in a Ni-rich positive electrode during the initial stages of electrochemical cycling. The investigation involves complementary cross-section analyses aimed at unraveling the connection between observed changes on both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The macroscopic constitutive properties were assessed using a U-shaped bending test method that had been previously developed. The compressive modulus exhibited substantial dependency on both the porous structure and binder properties. It experienced a notable reduction with electrolyte wetting but demonstrated an increase with cycling and aging. During the initial stages of aging, electrochemical impedance spectra revealed increased local resistance near the particle–electrolyte interface. This is likely attributable to factors such as secondary particle grain separation and the redistribution of carbon black. The swelling of particles, compression of the binder phase, and enhanced particle contact were identified as probable factors adding to the elevation of the elastic modulus within the porous layer as a result of cycling.

Here, two chelated chromium complexes that are structural isomers are characterized and combined to generate electrolytes containing up to 2 M of active species, corresponding to 53.6 Ah L −1 . The mixed isomer approach enables a significantly higher active material content than the individual materials would allow, affording energy dense cells with Coulombic efficiencies of ≥99.6% at 100 mA cm −2 and an open circuit voltage of 1.65 V at 50% state-of-charge. This high concentration, however, comes with a caveat; at a given concentration, an equimolar mixed electrolyte leads to lower voltage efficiency compared to using the individual isomers, while Coulombic efficiency remains constant. Our work demonstrates that exploiting structural isomerism is an efficient approach to improve capacity, but active materials must be selected carefully in mixed systems as differences in operating potentials negatively affect energy efficiency.

EV batteries are retired when they are no longer suitable for energy-intensive EV operations. A large number of EV batteries are expected to be retired in the next 5–10 years. These retired batteries have 70–80% average capacity left. Second-life use of these battery packs has the potential to address the increasing energy storage system (ESS) demand for the grid and also to create a circular economy for EV batteries. The needs of modern grids for frequency regulation, power smoothing, and peak shaving can be met using retired batteries. Moreover, these batteries can also be employed for revenue generation for energy arbitrage (EA). While there are articles reviewing the general applications of retired batteries, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the research work on applications of the second-life batteries (SLBs) specific to the power grid and SLB degradation.

Thus, the current Li battery is always facing the problems of low energy density and safety. Additionally, the sustainable supply of Li due to the scarce abundance of Li sources is another problem. An all-solid-state Mg battery is expected to solve the problems owing to non-flammable solid-state electrolytes, high capacity/safety of divalent Mg metal anode and high abundance of Mg sources; therefore, solid-state electrolytes and all-solid-state Mg batteries have been researched intensively last two decades.

Herein, we report on a new Si powder anode in the form of electrospun fibers with only poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) binder and no electrically conductive carbon. The performance of this anode was contrasted to a fiber mat composed of Si powder, PAA binder, and a small amount of carbon powder. Fiber mat electrodes were evaluated in half-cells with a Li metal counter/reference electrode. Without the addition of conductive carbon, a stable capacity of about 1500 mAh/g (normalized to the total weight of the anode) was obtained at 1C for 50 charge/discharge cycles when the areal loading of silicon was 0.30 mg Si /cm 2 , whereas a capacity of 800 mAh/g was obtained when the Si loading was increased to ~1.0 mg Si /cm 2 . On a Si weight basis, these capacities correspond to >3500 mAh/g Si . The capacities were significantly higher than those found with a slurry-cast powdered Si anode with PAA binder. There was no change in fiber anode performance (gravimetric capacity and constant capacity with cycling) when a small amount of electrically conductive carbon was added to the electrospun fiber anodes when the Si loading was ≤1.0 mg Si /cm 2 .

The Influence of Testing Conditions on State of Health Estimations of Electric Vehicle Lithium-Ion Batteries Using an Incremental Capacity Analysis,"Alejandro Gismero, Matthieu Dubarry, Jia Guo, Daniel-Ioan Stroe, Erik Schaltz",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9120568,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/568/pdf?version=1700991194,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/568,2,"The increasing growth of the second-hand electric vehicle market demands reliable methods for evaluating the state of health of deployed electric vehicle batteries. Among these methods, incremental capacity analysis is a commonly used technique for state of health evaluation via the quantification of degradation modes. While the optimal conditions for its application typically involve low currents and a controlled temperature, this cannot be easily applied to deployed batteries. It is therefore essential to understand the impact of varying charging rates and temperatures on the accuracy of the analysis. In this study, the characteristics and behavior of incremental capacity features for seven electric vehicle batteries tested under different calendar aging conditions were investigated. The results show that accurate state of health estimations under different test conditions could be obtained using specific electrochemical features. Full article"
Sustainable Lithium Ferro-Phosphate Cathode Manufacturing: A Semi-Dry Approach with Water-Based Processing and Polytetrafluorethylene Binders,"Eike Wiegmann, Steffen Fischer, Matthias Leeb, Arno Kwade",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9120567,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/567/pdf?version=1701830236,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/12/567,9,"A novel water-based lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) cathode manufacturing process characterized by a significant reduction in the amount of solvent has been developed (semi-dry). To establish and validate this new process, Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) is used as a binder, with a binder content of 1 wt.%, minimizing the amount of inactive material within the electrode. Extrusion screws with multiple kneading zones stress the PTFE more intensively and thus produce more and smaller fibrils. The resulting extent of fibrillation is quantified by melting enthalpy as well as mechanical electrode properties. The degree of fibrillation of the binder in an electrode is known to influence the conductive electric and ionic pathways, which in turn affect the discharge capacity. It is shown that this process provides a flexible cathode layer that achieves a specific capacitance of 155 mAh g −1 in initial cycling tests at 0.1 C. Compared to a conventionally processed LFP cathode, the discharge capacity and overall energy output are significantly increased, and the overall energy consumption decreases for the semi-dry processed LFP cathodes.

Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that a biopolymer (kraft lignin, which is, essentially, a waste material) can substitute a petroleum-derived polymer (PAN). Moreover, this can be achieved using a much faster and safer fiber-forming method. The present work employs the solution blowing of lignin-derived nonwovens and their carbonization to form electrode materials. These materials are characterized and explored as the electrodes in supercapacitor prototypes. Given the porosity importance of carbon fibers in SC applications, N 2 gas adsorption tests were performed for characterization. LCNFs revealed the specific surface area (SSA) and capacitance values as high as 1726 m 2 /g and 11.95 F/g, which are about one-half of those for PCNFs, 3624 m 2 /g and 25.5 F/g, respectively. The capacitance values of LCNFs are comparable with those reported in the literature, but the SSA observed here is much higher. Moreover, no further post-carbonization activation steps were performed here in comparison with those materials reported in the literature. It was also found here that fiber pre-oxidation in air prior to carbonization and the addition of zinc chloride affect the SSA and capacitance values of both LCNFs and PCNFs. The electrochemical tests of the SCs prototypes were used to evaluate their capacitance at different charging rates, voltage windows, and the number of cycles. The capacitance of PCNFs decreased by about 47% during fast charging, while the capacitance of LCNFs improved during fast charging, bringing them to the level of only 21% below that of PCNFs. These changes were correlated with the packing density of the electrodes. It should be emphasized that LCNFs revealed a much higher mass yield, which was 4–5 times higher than that of PCNFs. LCNFs also possess a higher packing density, a lower price, and cause a significantly lower environmental impact than PCNFs. The best cell supercapacitor delivered a maximum specific energy of 1.77 Wh/kg and a maximum specific power of 156 kW/kg, surpassing conventional electrochemical supercapacitors. Remarkably, it retained 95.2% of its initial capacitance after 10,000 GCD cycles at a current density of 0.25 A/g, indicating robust stability. Accordingly, kraft lignin, a bio-waste material, holds great promise as a raw material for supercapacitor electrodes. Full article"

Nevertheless, predicting the SOH of lithium-ion batteries by analyzing full charge–discharge patterns in everyday situations can be a daunting task. Moreover, to conduct this by analyzing relaxation phase traits necessitates a more extended idle waiting period. In order to confront these challenges, this study offers a SOH prediction method based on the features observed during the constant voltage charging stage, delving into the rich information about battery health contained in the duration of constant voltage charging. Innovatively, this study suggests using statistics of the time of constant voltage ( CV ) charging as health features for the SOH estimation model. Specifically, new features, including the duration of constant voltage charging, the Shannon entropy of the time of the CV charging sequence, and the Shannon entropy of the duration increment sequence, are extracted from the CV charging phase data. A battery’s State-of-Health estimation is then performed via an elastic net regression model. The experimentally derived results validate the efficacy of the approach as it attains an average mean absolute error ( MAE ) of only 0.64%, a maximum root mean square error ( RMSE ) of 0.81%, and an average coefficient of determination ( R 2) of 0.98. The above statement serves as proof that the suggested technique presents a substantial level of precision and feasibility for the estimation of SOH . Full article"

With the expansion of cell sizes, the internal negative electrode potential distribution gradually becomes inconsistent. However, the existing negative electrode potential estimation models and fast charging strategies have not yet considered the impact of consistency, and the model estimation accuracy will be greatly influenced by different temperatures and charging rates. This study proposes an online lithium-free fast charging equivalent circuit model (OLFEM) for estimating the negative electrode potential terminal voltage and developing fast charging strategies of long-dimensional LIBs in real vehicles. This study employs distributed reference electrodes integrated into long-dimensional LIBs and compares the negative electrode potential measured in the vicinity of both the negative and positive tabs. Subsequently, based on the lowest negative electrode potential point, model parameters were obtained at different temperatures and charging rates. This model is further verified under different operating conditions. Finally, a fast-charging strategy without lithium plating is developed in real-time based on the negative electrode potential estimated by the model. The results demonstrate that long-dimensional cells exhibit a lower negative electrode potential on the positive tab side. Across various temperatures and charging rates, the calibrated model achieves a negative electrode potential estimated error within 25 mV, and the estimation error for terminal voltage is within 5 mV. The proposed fast-charging method prevents lithium plating and charges the cell up to 96.8% within an hour. After 100 cycles, the cell experiences a capacity degradation of less than 2%, and the disassembly results indicate that no lithium precipitation has occurred. The methods outlined in this study provide valuable insights for online fast charging of large-dimensional batteries without lithium plating. Full article"

However, a few cases of lithium-ion battery fires and failures caused by thermal runaway have been reported in various news articles; therefore, it is important to enhance the safety of the batteries and their end users. The early detection of thermal runaway by detecting gases/volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released at the initial stages of thermal runaway can be used as a warning to end users. An interdigitated platinum electrode spin-coated with a sub-micron thick layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) showed sensitivity for two VOCs (ethyl-methyl carbonate and methyl formate) released from Li-ion batteries during thermal runaway, as well as their binary mixtures at elevated temperatures, which were measured using impedance spectroscopy over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The sensor response was tested at three different high temperatures (40 °C, 55 °C, and 70 °C) for single analytes and binary mixtures of two VOCs at 5 ppm, 15 ppm, and 30 ppm concentrations. Equivalent electrical parameters were derived from impedance data. A machine learning approach was used to classify the sensor’s response. Classification algorithms classify the sensor’s response at elevated temperatures for different analytes with an accuracy greater than 70%. The success of the reported sensors will enhance battery safety via the early detection of thermal runaway. Full article"

The composite cathode consists of LiFePO 4 as the active material, Super P and KS-4 carbon materials as the conductive agents, and LiTFSI as the lithium salt. An LiFePO 4 /LATP-PVDF-HFP/Li all-solid-state LIB was assembled using Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP)/ poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) as the solid-state electrolyte and lithium metal as the anode. The structure of the synthesized LATP was analyzed using X-ray diffraction, and the microstructure of the composite cathode and solid electrolyte layer was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope. The electrochemical properties of the all-solid-state LIB were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and a charge–discharge test. The effect of the composition ratio of the fabricated cathode on SSLIB performance is discussed. The results reveal that the SSLIB fabricated using the cathode containing LiFePO 4 , Super P, KS-4, PVDF, and LiTFSI at a weight ratio of 70:10:10:7:3 (wt.%) and a LATP/PVDF-HFP solid electrolyte layer containing PVDF-HFP, LiTFSI, and LATP at a weight ratio of 22:33:45 (wt.%) exhibited the optimal performance. Particularly, the SSLIB fabricated using the cathode containing 3% LiTFSI exhibited a discharge capacity of 168.9 mAhg −1 at 0.1 C, which is close to the theoretical capacity (170 mAhg −1 ), and had very good stability. The findings of this study suggests that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of LiTFSI can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of SSLIB batteries. Full article"

Since they are not naturally electroactive, in order to allow their use in LiBs, it is necessary to mix the ionic liquids with lithium salts (Li). Li–PF6, Li–BF4, and Li–TFSI are among the lithium salts more frequently used in LiBs, and each anion, namely PF6 (hexafluorophosphate), BF4 (tetrafluoroborate), and TFSI (bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)azanide), has its own solvation characteristics and interaction profile with the pyrrolidinium ions. The size of Pyr cations, the anion size and symmetry, and cation–anion combinations influence the Li-ion solvation properties. In this work, we used molecular dynamics calculations to achieve a comprehensive view of the role of each cation–anion combination and of different fractions of lithium in the solutions to assess their relative advantage for Li-ion battery applications, by comparing the solvation and structural properties of the systems. This is the most-comprehensive work so far to consider pyrrolidinium-based ILs with different anions and different amounts of Li: from it, we can systematically determine the role of each constituent and its concentration on the structural and dynamic properties of the electrolyte solutions.

As a result, it is possible to subject LIB cells to thorough mechanical abuse tests to determine when and why failure may occur. The indentation test is a recommended loading condition for evaluating mechanical damage and ISC. In this study, 18,650 cylindrical battery cells underwent indentation tests and a voltage reduction following the peak force identified by the ISC. Due to the complexity of the contact surface shape between two cylinders (LIB cell and indenter), a new phenomenological analytical model is proposed to measure the projected contact area, which the FEM model confirms. Moreover, the stress-strain curve and Young’s modulus reduction were calculated from the load-depth data. In contrast to previously published models, the model developed in this paper assumes anisotropic hyperelasticity (the transversely isotropic case) and predicts the growing load-carrying capacity (scalar damage), whose variation is regulated by the Caputo-Almeida fractional derivative.

How Cell Design Affects the Aging Behavior: Comparing Electrode-Individual Aging Processes of High-Energy and High-Power Lithium-Ion Batteries Using High Precision Coulometry,"Sebastian Michael Peter Jagfeld, Kai Peter Birke, Alexander Fill, Peter Keil",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9040232,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/232/pdf?version=1682581097,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/232,11,"The aging behavior of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for the development of electric vehicles and many other battery-powered devices. The cells can be generally classified into two types: high-energy (HE) and high-power (HP) cells. The cell type used depends on the field of application. As these cells differ in their electrical behavior, this work investigates whether both cell types also show different aging behavior. More precisely, the occurring capacity loss and internal side reactions are analyzed via the charge throughput. For comparison, aging tests are carried out with a high-precision battery tester, allowing the application of High Precision Coulometry (HPC). This enables early detection of aging effects and also allows us to break down the capacity loss into electrode-individual processes. A total of two sub-studies are performed: (1) a cyclic study focusing on lithium plating; and (2) an accelerated calendar aging study. It is found that HE cells exhibit stronger cyclic aging effects (lithium plating) and HP cells exhibit stronger calendar aging effects. The higher lithium plating can be explained by the higher diffusion resistance of the lithium ions within the electrodes of HE Cell. The higher calendar aging fits to the larger electrode surfaces of the HP cell. These results give deep insights into the proceeding aging in a novel way and are interesting for the selection of the appropriate cell type in the context of battery development. In a next step, the measured capacity losses could also be used for a simple parameterization of battery aging models. Full article"

The European electric vehicles fleet in 2020 was taken as a case study, assuming a 10-year lifetime for the batteries and that the related EoL LIBs would be processed by existing recycling plants via pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, or their combination in sequence. The economic implications (recycling operative costs compared to the revenues from the sales of the recycled metals) and the environmental performances (CO 2 eq. emitted, energy demand and circularity performances) were assessed. Based on the gathered results, the existing European recycling capacity will overlook over 78% of the forecasted EoL LIBs. The treatment efficiencies of the full-scale recycling processes allow for the recovery of over 90% of copper, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, 87% of aluminum, and only 42% of lithium and 35% of iron entering the recycling facilities. In overall, LIBs recycling in 2030 will involve the emission of 3.7 Mt of CO 2 eq. and an energy demand of 33.6 GWh. Hydrometallurgy presents the best economic and environmental trade-off compared to other recycling strategies. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that current European LIBs’ recycling infrastructure will be inadequate in the near future and the direction (i.e., hydrometallurgy) that its strengthening should pursue.

Apparent Aging during Accelerated Cycling Aging Test of Cylindrical Silicon Containing Li-Ion Cells,"Pablo Morales Torricos, Christian Endisch, Meinert Lewerenz",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9040230,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/230/pdf?version=1681795355,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/230,15,"Accelerated cyclic aging tests are very important for research and industry to quickly characterize lithium-ion cells. However, the accentuation of stress factors and the elimination of rest periods lead to an apparent capacity fade, that can be subsequently recovered during a resting phase. This effect is attributed to the inhomogeneous lithium distribution in the anode and is observable with differential voltage analysis (DVA). We tested cylindrical 18,650 cells with Li(Ni x Co y Al z )O 2 -graphite/silicon chemistry during two cycling and resting phases. The capacity, the pulse resistance, the DVA, and the capacity difference analysis are evaluated for cells cycled at different average SOC and current rates. An apparent capacity loss of up to 12% was reported after 200 FCE for cells cycled under the presence of pressure gradients, while only 1% were at low-pressure gradients. The subsequent recovery was up to 80% of the apparent capacity loss in some cases. The impact of silicon cannot be estimated as it shows no features in the dV / dQ curves. We observe a recovery of apparent resistance increase, which is not reported for cells with pure graphite anodes. Finally, we demonstrate the strong impact of apparent aging for the lifetime prediction based on standard accelerated cyclic aging tests. Full article"

Nevertheless, TiO 2 (B) requires efficient modification, e.g., suitable doping with other elements, to improve the electronic properties and enhance the stability upon insertion/extraction of guest ions. However, due to the metastability of TiO 2 (B), doping is challenging. Herein, for the first time, TiO 2 (B) co-doped with Mn, F, and N were synthesized through a successive method based on a hydrothermal technique. The prepared doped TiO 2 (B) consists of ultrathin nanotubes (outer diameter of 10 nm, wall thickness of 2–3 nm) and exhibits a highly porous structure (pore volume of up to 1 cm 3 g −1 ) with a large specific surface area near 200 m 2 g −1 . The incorporation of Mn, F, and N into TiO 2 (B) expands its crystal lattice and modifies its electronic structure. The band gap of TiO 2 (B) narrows from 3.14 to 2.18 eV upon Mn- and N-doping and electronic conductivity improves more than 40 times. Doping with fluorine improves the thermal stability of TiO 2 (B) and prevents its temperature-induced transformation into anatase. It was found that the diffusivity of Li is about two times faster in doped TiO 2 (B). These properties make Mn, F, and N co-doped TiO 2 (B) nanotubes promising for application as high-performance anodes in advanced lithium-ion batteries. In particular, it possesses a good reversible capacity (231.5 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles at 70 mA g −1 ) and prominent rate capability (134 mAh g −1 at 1500 mA g −1 ) in the half-cell configuration. The (Mn, F, N)-doped TiO 2 (B) possesses a remarkable low-temperature Li storage performance, keeping 70% of capacity at −20 °C and demonstrating potentialities to be employed in full-cell configuration with LiMn 2 O 4 cathode delivering a reversible capacity of 123 and 79 mAh g −1 at 35 and 1500 mA g −1 , respectively, at a voltage of ~2.5 V. This research underlies that regulation of electronic and crystal structure is desired to uncover capabilities of nanoparticulate TiO 2 (B) for electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

Currently, there is a lack of descriptors to rationally guide the regional electrode design. Here, we propose two descriptors, the time differential of the average state of lithium (SoL) and the span of SoL in individual particles, to identify the rate performance constraints across the electrode depth. 3D microstructure-based electrochemical simulations are performed on a homogeneous electrode, and the predictability of the microstructure-based model is verified with the experimental measurement on a LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 electrode. At electrode level, the descriptors divide the electrode into four regions, namely, a solid-state transport (SST)-controlled region, two mixed SST and liquid-state transport (LST)-controlled regions (SST-dominant and LST-dominant, respectively), and an LST-controlled region. Based on these insights, dual-gradient electrodes are designed with smaller particles in the SST-controlled region and graded porosity increasing from current collector to the separator. Results show that the optimized dual-gradient electrode has significantly more excellent LST capability compared to the homogeneous electrode, thus improving the utilization of particles near the collector. As a result, the capacity performance of the optimized dual-gradient electrode increases by 39% at 5C without sacrificing the gravimetric energy density. Full article"

During the initial charge, electrolyte is reduced to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the carbon anode surface, which is an electron insulator but a good ion conductor. Thus, a stable surface passivation is obtained, preventing the decomposition of electrolyte in the following cycles. It has been widely accepted that SEI is essential for the long-term performance of batteries, such as calendar life and cycle life. Additionally, the initial coulombic efficiency, rate capability as well as safety of the batteries are dramatically influenced by the SEI. Extensive research efforts have been made to develop advanced SEI on carbon materials via optimization of electrolytes, including solutes, solvents and additives, etc. However, SEI is produced via the catalytic decomposition of electrolyte by the surface of electrode materials. The surface structure of the carbon material is another important aspect that determines the structure and property of SEI, which little attention has been paid to in previous years. Hence, this review is dedicated to summarizing the impact of the surface structure of carbon materials on the composition, structure and electrochemical performance of the SEI in terms of surface atoms exposed, surface functionalization, specific surface area and pore structure. Some insights into the future development of SEI from the perspective of carbon surface are also offered. Full article"

According to many experts, the use of electric vehicles constitutes one of the most promising alternatives for achieving the desirable reductions in emissions. However, popularization of these vehicles is being slowed by long recharging times and the low availability of recharging stations. One possible solution to this issue is to employ the concept of battery sharing or battery swapping. This concept is supported by important industrial partners, such as Eni in Italy, Ample in the US, and Shell in the UK. This paper supports the introduction of battery swapping practices by analyzing their effects. A discrete-event simulation model is employed for this study. The obtained results show that battery sharing practices are not just a more environmentally and socially friendly solution, but also one that can be highly beneficial for reducing traffic congestion.

Since the degradation of lithium batteries can easily be influenced by different operating conditions and the regeneration and fluctuation of battery capacity during the use of lithium batteries, it is difficult to construct an accurate prediction model of lithium batteries. Therefore, research into high-precision methods of predicting the remaining useful life has been a popular topic for the whole-life management system of lithium batteries. In this paper, a new hybrid optimization method for predicting the remaining useful life of lithium batteries is proposed. The proposed method incorporates two different swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. Firstly, the whale optimization algorithm is used to optimize the variational mode decomposition (WOAVMD), which can decompose the historical life data into several trend components and non-trend components. Then, the sparrow search algorithm is applied to optimize the long short-term memory neural network (SSALSTM) to predict the non-trend component and the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) is used to predict trend components. Finally, the prediction results of each component are integrated to evaluate the remaining useful life of lithium batteries. Results show that better prediction accuracy is obtained in the prediction experiments for several types of batteries in both the NASA and CALCE battery datasets. The generalization ability of the algorithm has also been effectively improved owing to the optimization of parameters of the variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM).

However, the dissolution of sodium polysulfide (NaPS) intermediates and their migration to the anode side give rise to the shuttle phenomenon that impedes the reaction kinetics leading to rapid capacity decay, poor coulombic efficiency, and severe loss of active material. Inhibiting the generation of long-chain NaPS or facilitating their adsorption via physical and chemical polysulfide trapping mechanisms is vital to enhancing the electrochemical performance of RT-NaSBs. This review provides a brief account of the polysulfide inhibition strategies employed in RT-NaSBs via physical and chemical adsorption processes via the electrode and interfacial engineering. Specifically, the sulfur immobilization and polysulfide trapping achieved by electrode engineering strategies and the interfacial engineering of the separator, functional interlayer, and electrolytes are discussed in detail in light of recent advances in RT-NaSBs. Additionally, the benefits of engineering the highly reactive Na anode interface in improving the stability of RT-NaSBs are also elucidated. Lastly, the future perspectives on designing high-performance RT-NaSBs for practical applications are briefly outlined. Full article"

The structural design of the cold plates is the key factor that directly determines the thermal performance of the liquid cooling system. In this study, seven Z-type parallel channel cold plate and two novel cross-linked channel cold plate designs are proposed for the cooling of high-power lithium-ion batteries using two different cooling strategies. The average battery temperature, battery temperature uniformity and energy consumption of all designs are firstly analyzed holistically by three-dimensional conjugated simulation under the scheme of continuous cooling. Two selected designs that demonstrated superior performance (i.e., a Z-type parallel channel cold plate with 8-branches and an improved cross-linked channel design) are further analyzed to explore their integrative performance under different cooling schemes. The results show that within a battery temperature limit of 40 °C, employing the delayed cooling strategy can save 23% energy consumption compared to the continuous cooling strategy. Besides, the cold plate with an improved cross-linked channel configuration requires 13% less pumping power and provides a better temperature uniformity than the Z-type parallel channel cold plate with 8-branches. These results are of great significance to advance the cooling design of BTMS. Full article"

The integration of MESSs could alleviate congestion, minimize renewable energy waste, fulfill unexpected energy demands, and lower the operational costs for power networks.

An understanding of the pressure distribution and gradients is necessary to optimize battery modules and avoid local degradation bearing the risk of safety-relevant battery changes. In this study, the pressure distribution of two fresh lithium-ion pouch cells was measured with an initial preload force of 300 or 4000 N N . Four identical cells were electrochemically aged with a 300 or 4000 N N preload force. The irreversible thickness change was measured during aging. After aging, the reversible swelling behavior was investigated to draw conclusions on how the pressure distribution affected the aging behavior. A novel test setup was developed to measure the local cell thickness without contact and with high precision. The results suggested that the applied preload force affected the pressure distribution and pressure gradients on the cell surface. The pressure gradients were found to affect the locality of the irreversible swelling. Positions suffering from large pressure variations and gradients increased strongly in thickness and were affected in terms of their reversible swelling behavior. In particular, the edges of the investigated cells showed a strong thickness increase caused by pressure peaks. Full article"

To achieve optimal control, advanced battery management systems (ABMSs) with health-conscious optimal control are required for highly dynamic applications where safe operation, extended battery life, and maximum performance are critical requirements. The majority of earlier research assumed that the battery cells in these energy storage systems were identical and would vary uniformly over time in terms of cell characteristics. However, in real-world situations, the battery cells might behave differently for a number of reasons. Overcharging and over-discharging are caused by an electrical imbalance that results from the cells’ differences in properties and capacity. Therefore in this study, a stratified real-time control scheme was developed for the dual purposes of minimizing the capacity fade and the energy losses of a battery pack. Each of the cells in the pack is represented by a degradation-conscious physics-based reduced-order equivalent circuit model. In view of the inconsistencies between cells, the proposed control scheme uses a state estimator such that the parametric values of the circuit elements in the cell model are determined and updated in a decentralized manner. The minimization of the capacity fade and energy losses is then formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem, from which the resulting optimal control strategy is realized through the switching actions of a modular multilevel series-parallel converter which interconnects the battery pack to an external AC system. A centralized controller ensures optimal switching sequence of the converter leading to the maximum utilization of the capacity of the battery pack. Both simulation and experimental results are used to verify the proposed methodologies which aim at minimizing the battery degradation by reconfiguring the battery cells dynamically in accordance with the state of health (SOH) of the pack.

Therefore, data cleaning and optimization is processed and the capacity of a battery pack is identified subsequently in combination with the improved two-point method. The current available capacity is obtained by a Fuzzy Kalman filter optimization capacity estimation curve, making use of the charging and discharging data segments. This algorithm is integrated into a new energy big data cloud platform.

Because of the limited open circuit voltage (OCV) by hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, together with the relatively low solubility of active species, RFBs with aqueous electrolytes are challenging to reach high energy densities. Researchers have been trying to develop new solvent systems without water to remove the electrochemical window limitation of water and pursue higher cell potential. However, non-aqueous solvents are also hindered by some key problems, such as high viscosity and poor safety. Meeting these challenges require a comprehensive understanding of relevant structural design parameters and multi-variable operation in the non-aqueous flow battery (NAFB) system. Modeling and simulation are not only an effective way to understand the basic mechanism of flow batteries at different scales of size and time but also an ideal tool for optimizing the reaction process, battery assembly, and the whole flow battery installation.

In this paper, the maximum efficiency of pulsed discharge method on a constant load while the cells are alternately switched with dead-time is thoroughly studied. Therefore, a novel Li-Ion charge/discharge and measurement device (SWD) using fast switching MOSFET was designed and fabricated. The device can alternately switch up to 8.3 kHz two Li-Ion 18650 batteries, generating continuous power to the programmable load and monitor the parameters that impact the capacity of the battery. An EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) analysis is employed to evaluate the impedance and the behavior of the cells at frequencies up to 10 kHz. Experimental results reveal that a maximum discharge time is determined when two cells are switched at a frequency of 5.8 kHz. As a consequence, the total capacity of two switched batteries in a single discharge cycle is increased by 16.6%. Pulsed discharge efficiency is visible starting from 70% State of Charge (SOC) and is correlated with the rest time, reduced heat loss and inductance, respectively. Full article"

In this paper, three cascaded fractional-order sliding-mode observers (FOSMOs) are designed for the estimation of SoC by observing the terminal voltage, the polarization voltage, and the open-circuit voltage of a lithium cell, respectively. Furthermore, to calculate the value of the SoH, two FOSMOs are developed to estimate the capacity and internal resistance of the lithium cell. The control signals of the observers are continuous by utilizing fractional-order sliding manifolds without low-pass filters. Compared with the existing sliding-mode observers for SoC and SoH, weaker chattering, faster response, and higher estimation accuracy are obtained in the proposed method.

Graphene, which has an extremely thin sheet-like structure, is considered as a fundamental carbon material. However, it was less investigated as an electrode material than graphite and activated carbons. This is because graphene is a relatively new material and is difficult to handle. However, using graphene electrodes can enhance the performance of nanodevices. Here, the performance of EDLCs based on single-layer and bilayer graphene electrodes in LiCl, NaCl, and KCl aqueous electrolyte solutions was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, and the charging mechanism was evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. KCl aqueous solution provided the highest capacitance compared to LiCl and NaCl aqueous solutions in the case of single-layer graphene electrodes. In contrast, the dependence of the capacitance on the ion species was hardly observed in the case of bilayer graphene. This indicates that Li and Na ions also contributed to the capacitances. The high EDLC performance can be attributed to the fast ion transfer promoted by the dehydration and modification of the second hydration shell on the bilayer graphene because of the relatively strong interaction of ions with the bilayer graphene.

HESSs consist of an integration of two or more single Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) to combine the benefits of each ESS and improve the overall system performance, e.g., efficiency and lifespan. Most recent studies on HESS mainly focus on power management and coupling between the different ESSs without a particular interest in a specific type of ESS. Over the last decades, Redox-Flow Batteries (RFBs) have received significant attention due to their attractive features, especially for stationary storage applications, and hybridization can improve certain characteristics with respect to short-term duration and peak power availability. Presented in this paper is a comprehensive overview of the main concepts of HESSs based on RFBs. Starting with a brief description and a specification of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of common electrochemical storage technologies suitable for hybridization with RFBs, HESS are classified based on battery-oriented and application-oriented KPIs. Furthermore, an optimal coupling architecture of HESS comprising the combination of an RFB and a Supercapacitor (SC) is proposed and evaluated via numerical simulation. Finally, an in-depth study of Energy Management Systems (EMS) is conducted. The general structure of an EMS as well as possible application scenarios are provided to identify commonly used control and optimization parameters. Therefore, the differentiation in system-oriented and application-oriented parameters is applied to literature data. Afterwards, state-of-the-art EMS optimization techniques are discussed. As an optimal EMS is characterized by the prediction of the system’s future behavior and the use of the suitable control technique, a detailed analysis of the previous implemented EMS prediction algorithms and control techniques is carried out. The study summarizes the key aspects and challenges of the electrical hybridization of RFBs and thus gives future perspectives on newly needed optimization and control algorithms for management systems.

Evaluation of Glyoxal-Based Electrolytes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"Sebastian Kirchhoff, Christian Leibing, Paul Härtel, Thomas Abendroth, Susanne Dörfler, Holger Althues, Stefan Kaskel, Andrea Balducci",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9040210,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/210/pdf?version=1680245625,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/210,7,"Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next generation battery technologies. First prototype cells show higher specific energies than conventional Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and the active material is cost-effective and ubiquitously abundant. However, Li-S batteries still suffer from several limitations, mainly the cycle life, inflation of cells, and also the lack of a component production value chain. As this battery system is based on a complex conversion mechanism, the electrolyte plays a key role, not only for specific energy, but also for rate capability, cycle stability and costs. Herein, we report on electrolytes based on glyoxylic-acetal based solvents, Tetraethoxyglyoxal (TEG) and Tetramethoxyglyoxal (TMG). These solvents have been examined before for supercapacitors and LIBs, but never for LSBs, although they exhibit some beneficial properties, and the production value chain has already been well established as they are precursors for several chemicals. A specially adapted electrolyte composition is established by adjusting solvent ratio and LiTFSI concentration in a TXG:DOL solvent blend. The obtained electrolytes show long cycle life as well as high coulombic efficiencies without the use of LiNO 3 , a component leading normally to cell inflation and safety issues. In addition, a successful evaluation in a multilayer Li-S-pouch cell was performed. The electrolytes were thoroughly characterized, and their sulfur conversion mechanism is discussed. Full article"

The LiMn 2 O 4 composite electrode is employed as the working electrode in this artificial cell, which is conceived and produced along with a chemo-mechanical coupling measurement system. The multi-layer beam composite electrode made of LiMn 2 O 4 is monitored in real time using a CCD camera to track its curvature deformation. Experiments show that the curvature of the LiMn 2 O 4 electrode decreases with the extraction of lithium ions and increases during the lithiation process. In the meantime, a theoretical framework was developed to examine the connection between curvature change and mechanical characteristics. Thus, the elastic modulus, strain, and stress of the LiMn 2 O 4 composite electrode were extracted by combining the bending deformation and theoretical model. The results show that the elastic modulus of the LiMn 2 O 4 composite electrode decreases from 59.61 MPa to 12.01 MPa with the extraction of lithium ions during the third cycle. Meanwhile, the stress decreases from 0.46 MPa to 0.001 MPa, and the strain reduces from 0.43 to 0. Its changes reverse during the lithiation process. Those findings could have made a further understanding of the mechanical properties in lithium-ion batteries. Full article"
A High-Performance Vortex Adjustment Design for an Air-Cooling Battery Thermal Management System in Electric Vehicles,"Gang Zhao, Xiaolin Wang, Michael Negnevitsky, Chengjiang Li, Hengyun Zhang, Yingyao Cheng",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9040208,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/208/pdf?version=1680263612,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/208,9,"To boost the performance of the air-cooling battery thermal management system, this study designed a novel vortex adjustment structure for the conventional air-cooling battery pack used in electric vehicles. T-shape vortex generating columns were proposed to be added between the battery cells in the battery pack. This structure could effectively change the aerodynamic patterns and thermodynamic properties of the battery pack, including turbulent eddy frequency, turbulent kinetic energy, and average Reynolds number, etc. The modified aerodynamic patterns and thermodynamic properties increased the heat transfer coefficient with little increase in energy consumption and almost no additional cost. Different designs were also evaluated and optimized under different working conditions. The results showed that the cooling performance of the Design 1 improved at both low and high air flow rates. At a small flow rate of 11.88 L/s, the T max and ΔT of Design 1 are 0.85 K and 0.49 K lower than the conventional design with an increase in pressure drop of 0.78 Pa. At a relative high flow rate of 47.52 L/s, the T max and ΔT of the Design 1 are also 0.46 K and 0.13 K lower than the conventional design with a slight increase in pressure drop of 17.88 Pa. These results demonstrated that the proposed vortex generating design can improve the cooling performance of the battery pack, which provides a guideline for the design and optimization of the high-performance air-cooling battery thermal management systems in electric vehicles.

Material and Waste Flow Analysis for Environmental and Economic Impact Assessment of Inorganic Acid Leaching Routes for Spent Lithium Batteries’ Cathode Scraps,"Yi-Chin Tang, Jian-Zhi Wang, Chih-Ming Chou, Yun-Hwei Shen",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9040207,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/207/pdf?version=1680170946,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/207,11,"With the development trend and technological progress of lithium batteries, the battery market is booming. This means that the demand for lithium batteries has increased significantly, resulting in a large number of discarded lithium batteries. The consumption of plenty of lithium batteries may lead to the scarcity and expending of relevant raw material metal resources, as well as serious heavy metal environmental pollution. Therefore, it is of great significance to recycle valuable metal resources from discarded lithium batteries. The proper recycling of these valuable metals can reduce the shortage of mineral resources and environmental hazards caused by a large number of scrapped vehicle batteries. Recently, different systematic approaches have been developed for spent lithium battery recovery. However, most of these approaches do not account for the hidden costs incurred from various processing steps. This work is determined by the concept of material flow cost accounting (MFCA). Hence, in this research, a MFCA-based approach is developed for the leaching process of spent lithium batteries recovery, taking into consideration the hidden costs embedded in process streams. In this study, hydrochloric acid had the worst leaching efficiency due to its high solid-to-liquid ratio and the lowest acid concentration, so it was excluded in the first stage selection. It takes TWD 16.03 and TWD 24.10 to leach 10 g of lithium battery powder with sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively. The final sulfuric acid was the acid solution with the highest leaching efficiency and relatively low cost among inorganic acids. Full article"
Experimental Investigation for the Phase Change Material Barrier Area Effect on the Thermal Runaway Propagation Prevention of Cell-to-Pack Batteries,"Kai Shen, Jieyu Sun, Chengshan Xu, Shaw Kang WONG, Yuejiu Zheng, Changyong Jin, Huaibin Wang, Siqi Chen, Xuning Feng",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9040206,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/206/pdf?version=1680166953,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/4/206,8,"Thermal runaway propagation (TRP) is a primary safety issue in lithium-ion battery (LIB) applications, and the use of a thermal barrier is considered to be a promising solution for TRP prevention. However, the operating conditions of the battery are extremely complicated, such as fast charging, low-temperature heating and thermal runaway. To date, there is no consistent answer as to how to choose the appropriate thermal barrier for such a complicated working environment. In this study, the characteristics of hydrogel based on sodium polyacrylate are explored, and the impact of thermal barrier area on TRP is investigated through experiments. Due to the prismatic battery structure, thermal barriers placed between cells are designed with different areas (148 × 98 mm, 128 × 88 mm, and 108 × 78 mm). The results indicate that test 1 without a placed thermal barrier quickly completes the TRP process, and the thermal runaway (TR) behavior is more violent. With a thermal barrier that does not have full area coverage placed between cells (test 2 and test 3), the propagation time is prolonged, but TRP still occurs. Compared with test 1, the triggered temperature of T2 F (the front surface of cell 2) is reduced by 207.6 °C and 295.2 °C, respectively. The complete area coverage thermal barrier successfully prevents TRP, and the T2 F of cell 2 only reaches 145.4 °C under the phase change by the hydrogel. This study may suggest a safety design for battery modules and prevent propagation among batteries. Full article"

The TiO X protective layer was fabricated in situ to directly optimize surface properties of Ti 3 C 2 T X , as well as to strengthen surface active functional groups. The initial discharge capacity of as-prepared TiO X @Ti 3 C 2 T X cathode reaches 7100 mAh g −1 at 2500 mA g −1 , as well as delivers impressive cycling stability (>100 cycles) at 2500 mA g −1 .

The module consists of 4 × 5 cylindrical batteries embedded in a liquid-cooled aluminum shell with multiple flow channels. The battery module thermal management and the suppression of thermal propagation were experimentally examined. The temperature rise of the battery in the discharging process is significantly greater than that in the charging phase. As the coolant flow speed increases, the maximum temperature of the battery module decreases slightly, while the temperature difference remains at the same level, at the expense of a much-increased pressure drop. With the presented liquid-cooled shell, the suppression of thermal propagation was investigated for both internal and corner battery thermal runaway. It is found that the temperature of the adjacent battery can be maintained at under 70 °C, indicating that the propagation of thermal runaway can be successfully suppressed by heat dissipation through the surrounding liquid flow. In addition, the electrically induced thermal profile along the battery interconnection was identified through thermal imaging. Hot spots were found on the confluence busbars of the batteries in series connection. In order to improve the safety of battery modules, a parallel battery connection in the battery module is recommended, which can reduce the busbar temperature by 4.86 °C, as determined through numerical simulations. Experimental measurements were also conducted to verify the simulation results. Full article"

However, due to the intrinsic complex reaction chemistry of sulfur cathodes and metal anodes, such as slow diffusion of the divalent ion, the shuttle of soluble polysulfide, and irreversible deposition of Mg ions on metal electrodes, Mg-S batteries still need further optimization to meet requirements for practical applications. In addition to stabilizing metal anodes, developing a suitable sulfur cathode is desperately needed. This review summarizes recent research progress in sulfur cathodes, interlayers, and non-nucleophilic electrolytes, highlighting the main challenges and corresponding strategies for electrode material designs. Notably, we emphasize a fundamental understanding of the structure-composition relationship. Furthermore, state-of-the-art characterization techniques are described that help reveal the pertinent electrochemical mechanisms whereby Mg-S cells function.

Among the two major energy storage devices (capacitors and batteries), electrochemical capacitors (known as ‘Supercapacitors’) play a crucial role in the storage and supply of conserved energy from various sustainable sources. The high power density and the ultra-high cyclic stability are the attractive characteristics of supercapacitors. However, the low energy density is a major downside of them, which is also responsible for the extensive research in this field to help the charge storage capabilities thrive to their limits. Discoveries of electrical double-layer formation, pseudocapacitive and intercalation-type (battery-type) behaviors drastically improved the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors. The introduction of nanostructured active materials (carbon-/metal-/redox-active-polymer/metal-organic/covalent-organic framework-based electrode materials), electrolytes (conventional aqueous and unconventional systems) with superior electrochemical stability and unprecedented device architectures further boosted their charge storage characteristics. In addition, the detailed investigations of the various processes at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces enable us to reinforce the present techniques and the approaches toward high-performance and next-generation supercapacitors. In this review, the fundamental concepts of the supercapacitor device in terms of components, assembly, evaluation, charge storage mechanism, and advanced properties are comprehensively discussed with representative examples.

Temperature and relative humidity during membrane deposition were also tracked to include them in the statistical analysis and highlight their influence on the properties of the resulting membranes. The functional evaluation of the membranes was conducted by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, after soaking the membrane in the electrolyte, to measure ion transport properties. All the separators showed specific conductivities higher than 1.5 × 10 −3 S. The electrochemical performance was also evaluated when the membranes were used as actual separators in coin-cells assembled in-house, stacking the electrolyte-soaked membranes between a lithium anode and a LiFePO 4 -based cathode.

Finding a comprise between complexity, computational effort and accuracy is thereby key. In particular, modelling sodium–nickel–chloride/iron-chloride cells ( Na- N i C l 2 / F e C l 2 ), as a promising alternative for stationary energy storage, bears some challenges. The literature shows a few interesting approaches, but in most of them the second active material ( N i C l 2 or F e C l 2 ) or the entire discharging/charging cycle is not considered. In this work, an electrochemical and thermal model of Na- N i C l 2 / F e C l 2 battery cells is presented. Based on an equivalent circuit approach combined with electrochemical calculations, the hybrid model provides information on the performance of the cell for charging and discharging with a constant current. By dividing the cathode space into segments, internal material and charge flows are predicted, allowing important insights into the internal cell processes. Besides a low calculation effort, the model also allows a flexible adaption of cathode composition and cell design, which makes it a promising tool for the development of single battery cells as well as battery modules and battery systems.

Other aspects, such as costs, processes, and environmental sustainability, must be considered. Research and development of new active materials allow some fundamental aspects of the batteries to be increased, such as power and energy density. However, one of the main future challenges is the improvement of the batteries’ electrochemical performance by using “non-active” materials (binder, current collector, separators) with a lower cost, lower environmental impact, and easier recycling procedure. Focusing on the binder, the main goal is to replace the current fluorinated compounds with water-soluble materials. Starting from these considerations, in this study we evaluate, for the first time, tragacanth gum (TG) as a suitable aqueous binder for the manufacturing process of a cobalt-free, high-voltage lithium nickel manganese oxide (LNMO) cathode. TG-based LNMO cathodes with a low binder content (3 wt%) exhibited good thermal and mechanical properties, showing remarkably high cycling stability with 60% capacity retention after more than 500 cycles at 1 C and an outstanding rate capability of 72 mAh g −1 at 15 C. In addition to the excellent electrochemical features, tragacanth gum also showed excellent recycling and recovery properties, making this polysaccharide a suitable and sustainable binder for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

Accurate State-of-Charge estimation of the lithium-ion battery energy storage systems is a critical task to ensure their reliable operations. Multiple advanced battery model-based SOC estimation algorithms have been developed to pursue this objective. Nevertheless, these battery model-based algorithms are sensitive to measurement noises since the measurement noises affect the accuracy of battery model identification, thus leading to inaccurate battery SOC estimation consequently due to modeling error. The Butterworth low-pass filter has proven effectiveness in measurement noise filtering for accurate parameter identification, while the cutoff frequency design relies on prior knowledge of lithium-ion batteries, making its capability limited to general cases. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive cutoff frequency design algorithm for the Butterworth low-pass filter. Simulation results show that the low-pass filter functions properly in the presence of multiple scales of measurement noises adopting the proposed work. Consequently, the parameters of the battery model and the SOC of the battery are both identified and estimated accurately, respectively. In detail, the parameters: R 0 , R 1 , C 1 , and the time constant τ are all identified accurately with low relative identification errors of 0.028%, 11.12%, 6.21%, and 5.94%, respectively, in an extreme case. Furthermore, the SOC of the battery can thus be estimated accurately, leaving a low of 0.081%, 0.97%, and 0.14% in the mean and maximum absolute SOC estimation error and the standard deviation, respectively.

Under such off-resonant conditions, even an empty cavity can lead to the charging of the quantum battery through a proper modulation of the matter–radiation coupling. This counterintuitive behaviour has its roots in the effective interaction between two-level systems mediated by virtual photons emerging from the fluctuations of the quantum electromagnetic field. In order to properly characterize it, we address relevant figures of merit such as the stored energy, the time required to reach the maximum charging, and the averaged charging power. Moreover, the possibility of efficiently extracting energy in various ranges of parameters is discussed. The scaling of stored energy and power as a function of the number N of two-level systems and for different values of the matter–radiation coupling is also discussed, showing, in the strong coupling regime, performances in line with what is reported for the Dicke quantum battery in the resonant regime.

Current passive safety strategies of traction batteries usually come at the cost of their volumetric or gravimetric energy density. This work analyses the influence of the variables cell selection and orientation within the traction battery on the crash safety of an electric-powered two-wheeler. These two variables do not negatively influence the traction battery’s volumetric or gravimetric energy density in the design process. Metamodels and numerical simulations are used to evaluate the crash safety of an electric-powered two-wheeler’s traction battery in a potentially dangerous crash scenario. The influence of the variable’s cell selection and orientation is evaluated through the internal short circuit risk of the integrated cells. The comparison of the metamodels shows that the cell orientation reduces the internal short circuit risk by up to 51% on average in the analysed crash scenario. The cell selection reduces it only up to 21% on average. The results show that crash safety can be increased in the design process, and a combination with the current protection strategies can increase crash safety further. Full article"

Among all components, choosing active cathode material (CAM) limits a cell’s available energy density (Wh kg −1 ), and the CAM selection becomes critical. Layered Lithium transition metal oxides, primarily, LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 (NMC) (x + y + z = 1), represent a prominent class of cathode materials for LIBs due to their high energy density and capacity. The battery performance metrics of NMC cathodes vary according to the different ratios of transition metals in the CAM. The non-electrode factors and their effect on the cathode performance of a lithium-ion battery are as significant in a commercial sense. These factors can affect the capacity, cycle lifetime, thermal safety, and rate performance of the NMC battery. Additionally, polycrystalline NMC comprises secondary clusters of primary crystalline particles prone to pulverization along the grain boundaries, which leads to microcrack formation and unwanted side reactions with the electrolyte. Single-crystal NMC (SC-NMC) morphology tackles the cycling stability issue for improved performance but falls short in enhancing capacity and rate capability. The compatibility of different combinations of electrolytes and additives for SC-NMC is discussed, considering the commercial aspects of NMC in electric vehicles. The review has targeted the recent development of non-aqueous electrolyte systems with various additives and aqueous and non-aqueous binders for NMC-based LIBs to stress their importance in the battery chemistry of NMC.

The coating adhesion increases with binder content, and the coating conductivity increases with carbon nano-tube content. The best coatings achieve 5C:0.2C capacity ratios above 50%, despite the relatively high coat weight. Models based on just the component mixture do not replicate the discharge capacities at high rates. However, a combined mixture + process model can fit the data, and is used to predict an optimum formulation. Full article"

Most of the current studies on the SOP estimation of lithium–ion batteries consider only a single constraint and rarely pay attention to the estimation of battery state on different time scales, which can reduce the accuracy of SOP estimation and even cause safety problems. In view of this, this paper proposes a multi-time scale and multi-constraint SOP estimation method for lithium–ion batteries based on H∞ filtering. Firstly, a second-order RC equivalent circuit model is established with a ternary lithium–ion monolithic battery as the research object, and parameter identification is performed by using the recursive least squares method with a forgetting factor. Secondly, the H∞ filtering algorithm is applied to estimate the state of charge (SOC), and then the joint multi-time scale multi-constrained SOC-SOP estimation is performed. Finally, the joint estimation algorithm is validated under UDDS conditions. The mean absolute value relative error (MARE) of SOC estimation is 1.17%, and the MARE of SOP estimation at different time scales is less than 1.6%. The results indicate the high accuracy and strong robustness of the joint estimation method. Full article"

However, it is very difficult to obtain multiple states of the battery with fewer sensors. In this paper, a joint estimation method for a lithium iron phosphate battery’s SOC and temperature based on ultrasonic reflection waves is proposed. A piezoelectric transducer is affixed to the surface of the battery for ultrasonic–electric transduction. Ultrasonic signals are excited at the transducer, transmitted through the battery, and transmitted back to the transducer by reaching the underside of the battery. Feature indicator extraction intervals of the battery state are determined by sliding–window matching correlation analysis. Virtual samples are used to expand the data after feature extraction. Finally, a backpropagation (BP) neural network model is applied to the multistate joint estimation of a battery in a wide temperature range. According to the experimental results, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the lithium-ion battery’s SOC and temperature estimation results is 7.42% and 0.40 °C, respectively. The method is nondestructive and easy to apply in battery management systems. Combined with the detection of gas production inside the battery, this method can improve the safety of the battery system. Full article"

It enhances volumetric power density, significantly reduces costs, and is widely utilized in electric vehicles. However, the flat open circuit voltage and significant polarization differences under wide operational temperatures are challenging for accurate voltage modeling of battery management systems (BMSs). In particular, inaccurate state of charge (SOC) estimation may cause overcharging and over-discharging risks. To accurately perceive the SOC of LiFePO 4 blade batteries, a SOC estimation method based on the backpropagation neural network-extended Kalman filter (BPNN-EKF) algorithm is proposed. BPNN is a neural network model that utilizes the backpropagation algorithm to update model parameters, while EKF is an optimal estimation algorithm. Firstly, dynamic working condition tests, including the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and high-speed working (HSW) condition tests, are conducted under a wide temperature range (−25–43 °C). HSW conditions refer to a simulated operating condition that mimics the driving of an electric vehicle on a highway. The minimum voltage of the battery system is used as the output for training the BPNN model. We derive the Kalman gain by combining the BPNN output voltage. Additionally, the EKF algorithm is employed to correct the SOC value using voltage error information. Concerning long SOC calculation intervals, capacity errors, initial SOC errors, and current and voltage sampling errors, the maximum SOC estimation RMSE is 3.98% at −20 °C NEDC, 3.62% at 10 °C NEDC, and 1.68% at 35 °C HSW. The proposed algorithm can be applied to different temperatures and operations, demonstrating high robustness. This BPNN-EKF algorithm has the potential to be embedded in electric vehicle BMS systems for practical applications. Full article"

To estimate the battery state of health (SOH), two aging features (AFs) are extracted based on the incremental capacity curve (ICC) to quantify capacity degradation, further analyzed through Pearson’s correlation coefficient. To further predict the remaining useful life (RUL), the online AFs are extrapolated to predict the degradation trends through the closed-loop least square method. To capture the underlying relationship between AFs and capacity, a random forest regression model is developed; meanwhile, the hyperparameters are determined using Bayesian optimization (BO) to enhance the learning and generalization ability.

However, due to the lack of the solid electrolyte interphase, problems such as dendrites, side reactions and hydrogen generation severely restrict their commercial applications. Herein, a quasi-liquid interphase (QLI) with a “solid–liquid” property is constructed to stabilize the Zn-metal anode. The synergistic effect of solid and liquid behavior ensures the stable existence of QLI and simultaneously enables the interphase dynamic and self-adaptive to the anode evolution.

However, monometallic iron-based electrodes still demonstrate an insufficient specific capacitance value in comparison to monometallic Mn-, Ni-, and Co-based compounds and their combined materials. Herein, an enhanced iron-based heterostructure of Fe 3 O 4 @Fe 2 P was prepared via the in situ phosphorization of Fe 3 O 4 . Compared to pristine Fe 3 O 4 , the Fe 3 O 4 @Fe 2 P heterostructure showed a capacity enhancement in KOH aqueous solution.

Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device using the Fe 3 O 4 @Fe 2 P heterostructure as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode delivers a high energy density of 13.47 Wh kg −1 , a high power density of 424.98 W kg −1 , and an acceptable capacitance retention of 78.5% after 5000 cycles. These results clarify that monometallic Fe based materials can deliver a potential practical application.

The accurate prediction of battery capacity can aid in optimizing its usage, extending its lifespan, and mitigating the risk of unforeseen failures. In this paper, we proposed a novel fine-tuning model based on a deep learning model with a transfer learning approach comprising of two key components: offline training and online prediction. Model weights and prediction parameters were transferred from offline training using source data to the online prediction stage. The transferred Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory with an Attention Mechanism model weights and prediction parameters were utilized to fine-tune the model by partial target data in the online prediction phase. Three battery batches with different charging policy were used to evaluate the proposed approach’s robustness, reliability, usability, and accuracy for the three charging policy batteries’ real-world data.

Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this fracture is minimized when the particle size is reduced below 100 nm; however, this is not a commercially viable solution. Herein, we employ a multiphysics model to capture damage in 1 µm and 2 µm Si particles for different degrees of partial lithiation and corresponding de-lithiation. It is seen that partial lithiation can reduce the mechanical stresses experienced by the Si particles and fracture is fully prevented when the Li-ion penetration does not exceed 360 nm and 600 mm for 1 µm and 2 µm Si particles, respectively, when they are distributed in a binder containing smaller Si particles of 500 nm and 1 µm particles, respectively, prior to de-insertion. This indicates that limiting lithiation to 72% for 1 µm Si particles and 66% for 2 µm Si particles can prevent their pulverization. Removing the smaller Si particles and having a uniform Si size distribution results in lower lithiation states for preventing fracture. Such design information is vital for battery developers in order to fully utilize the capabilities of Si. Full article"

In this study, an integrated prediction method is introduced to highlight the prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and RUL. This approach incorporates several techniques, including variational modal decomposition (VMD) with entropy detection, a double Gaussian model, and a gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU NN). Specifically, the PE−VMD algorithm is first utilized to perform a noise reduction process on the capacity data obtained from the measurements, and this results in a global degradation trend sequence and local fluctuation sequences. Afterward, the global degradation prediction model is established by employing the double Gaussian aging model proposed in this paper, and the local prediction models are built for each local fluctuation sequence by GRU NN. Lastly, the proposed hybrid prediction methodology is validated through battery capacity and RUL prediction studies on experimental data from three sources, and its accuracy is also compared with prediction algorithms from the recent related literature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid prediction method exhibits high precision in the predicting future capacity and RUL of lithium-ion batteries, along with strong robustness and predictive stability.

PHEVs have more complex operating conditions than EVs due to their dual energy sources. Therefore, the SOH estimation for PHEV vehicles needs to consider the specific operating characteristics of the PHEV and make calibrations accordingly. Firstly, we estimated the initial SOH by combining data-driven and empirical models. The data-driven method used was the incremental state of charge (SOC)-capacity method, and the empirical model was the Arrhenius model. This method can obtain the battery degradation trend and predict the SOH well in realistic applications. Then, according to the multiple characteristics of PHEV, we conducted a correlation analysis and selected the UF as the calibration factor because the UF has the highest correlation with SOH. Finally, we calibrated the parameters of the Arrhenius model using the UF in a fuzzy logic way, so that the calibrated fitting degradation trends could be closer to the true SOH. The proposed calibration method was verified by a PHEV dataset that included 11 vehicles. The experiment results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SOH fitting after UF calibration can be decreased by 0.2–14% and that the coefficient of determination ( R 2 R 2 ) for the calibrated fitting trends can be improved by 0.5–32%.

However, issues of inferior capacities and poor rate performance owing to limited inherent electronic conductivity and severe dissolution still persist. Herein, sandwich-structured perylene diimide-ethylene diamine/graphene (PDI-EDA/EG) composites are judiciously designed and synthesized. The two-dimensional graphene host can interact with the PDI-EDA polymer through π–π stacking, endowing accelerated ion/electron transfer, abundant active sites, excellent structural integrity, and mitigated solubility of the hybrid electrodes. When evaluated as an anode in ZIB, the hybrid electrode delivers a high capacity (110.2 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 ), superior rate capability (88.9 mAh g −1 at 5 A g −1 ), and exceptional durability (93.4% capacity retained after 1000 cycles). The structure evolution of the hybrid electrode during the insertion/extraction cycle was investigated by ex-situ Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing the reversible Zn 2+ storage at carbonyl sites. In addition, a prototype rocking-chair ZIB cell was constructed with a zinc pre-intercalated MnO 2 cathode, displaying an ultrahigh energy density of 54.9 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 42.5 W kg −1 and excellent stability with negligible capacity decay after 1000 cycles.

Enhancing Lithium-Ion Battery Manufacturing Efficiency: A Comparative Analysis Using DEA Malmquist and Epsilon-Based Measures,"Chia-Nan Wang, Fu-Chiang Yang, Nhut T. M. Vo, Van Thanh Tien Nguyen",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9060317,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/317/pdf?version=1686102545,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/317,34,"Innovative carbon reduction and sustainability solutions are needed to combat climate change. One promising approach towards cleaner air involves the utilization of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and electric power vehicles, showcasing their potential as innovative tools for cleaner air. However, we must focus on the entire battery life cycle, starting with production. By prioritizing the efficiency and sustainability of lithium-ion battery manufacturing, we can take an essential step toward mitigating climate change and creating a healthier planet for future generations. A comprehensive case study of the leading LIB manufacturers demonstrates the usefulness of the suggested hybrid methodology. Initially, we utilized the Malmquist model to evaluate these firms’ total efficiency while dissecting their development into technical and technological efficiency change components. We employed the Epsilon-Based Measure (EBM) model to determine each organization’s efficiency and inefficiency scores. The findings show that the EBM approach successfully bridged the gap in the LIB industry landscape. Combined with the Malmquist model, the resulting framework offers a powerful and equitable evaluation paradigm that is easily applicable to any domain. Furthermore, it accurately identifies the top-performing organizations in specific aspects across the research period of 2018–2021. The EBM model demonstrates that most organizations have attained their top level, except for A10, which has superior technology adoption but poor management. A1, A2, A4, A6, A8, A9, and A10 were unable to meet their targets because of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite productivity improvements. A12 leads the three highest-scoring enterprises in efficiency and total productivity changes, while A3 and A5 should focus on innovative production techniques and improved management. The managerial implications provide vital direction for green energy practitioners, enhancing their operational effectiveness. Concurrently, consumers can identify the best LIB manufacturers, allowing them to invest in long-term green energy solutions confidently. Full article"
Model Predictive Control for Residential Battery Storage System: Profitability Analysis,"Patrick Kobou Ngani, Jean-Régis Hadji-Minaglou",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9060316,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/316/pdf?version=1686102350,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/316,3,"For increased penetration of energy production from renewable energy sources at a utility scale, battery storage systems (BSSs) are a must. Their levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) has drastically decreased over the last decade. Residential battery storage, mostly combined with photovoltaic (PV) panels, also follow this falling prices trend. The combined effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine has caused such a dramatic increase in electricity prices that many consumers have adjusted their strategies to become prosumers and self-sufficient as feed-in subsidies continue to drop. In this study, an investigation is conducted to determine how profitable it is to install BSSs in homes with regards to battery health and the levelized cost of total managed energy. This is performed using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) in MATLAB, along with its embedded solver Intlinprog. The results show that a reasonable optimized yearly cycling rate of the BSS can be reached by simply considering a non-zero cost for energy cycling through the batteries. This cost is simply added to the electricity cost equation of standard optimization problems and ensures a very good usage rate of the batteries. The proposed control does not overreact to small electricity price variations until it is financially worth it. The trio composed of feed-in tariffs (FITs), electricity costs, and the LCOE of BSSs represents the most significant factors. Ancillary grid service provision can represent a substantial source of revenue for BSSs, besides FITs and avoided costs. Full article"

However, the use of liquid electrolytes poses certain challenges, including lithium dendrite penetration and flammable liquid leakage. Encouragingly, solid electrolytes endowed with high stability and safety appear to be a potential solution to these problems. Among them, ionic liquids (ILs) packed in metal organic frameworks (MOFs), known as ILs@MOFs, have emerged as a hybrid solid-state material that possesses high conductivity, low flammability, and strong mechanical stability. ILs@MOFs plays a crucial role in forming a continuous interfacial conduction network, as well as providing internal ion conduction pathways through the ionic liquid.

In this work, the flow rate is optimized by incorporating the temperature effects, attempting to realize a more accurate flow control and subsequently enhance the performance of vanadium flow batteries. This work starts with the development of a comprehensive dynamic model on the basis of mass conservation, followed by a modeling validation and a thorough investigation of the temperature effects on electrolyte viscosity and internal resistance. After that, the flow rate is optimized to incorporate such effects. It is found that the flow rate strategy needs to be regulated with the variation of temperature due to the variations of electrolyte viscosity and internal resistance. Moreover, a relatively low flow rate is preferable for low-temperature applications, while for the high-temperature use, a relatively high flow rate is encouraged. Such in-depth investigation can not only provide a cost-effective method to optimize the flow rate and predict the behaviors of vanadium flow batteries, but can also be of great benefit to the management, application, and promotion of vanadium flow batteries.

For this reason, different aqueous Zn-MnO 2 battery technologies are discussed in this short review, focusing on how electrolytes with different pH affect the battery. Improvements and achievements in alkaline aqueous Zn-MnO 2 batteries the recent years have been briefly reviewed. Additionally, mild to acidic aqueous electrolyte employment in Zn-MnO 2 batteries has been described, acknowledging their potential success, as such a battery design can increase the potential by up to 2 V. However, we have also recognized a novel battery electrolyte type that could increase even more scientific interest in aqueous Zn-MnO 2 batteries. Consisting of an alkaline electrolyte in the anode compartment and an acidic electrolyte in the cathode compartment, this dual (amphoteric) electrolyte system permits the extension of the battery cell potential above 2 V without water decomposition.

The anisotropic nature of these materials results in a strong correlation between particle morphology and ion transport. In this work, we present a multiphase-field framework that is able to account for strongly anisotropic diffusion in polycrystalline materials. Various secondary particle structures with random grain orientation as well as strongly textured samples are investigated. The observed ion distributions match well with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we show how these simulations can be used to mimic potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) measurements and compute effective diffusion coefficients for secondary particles. The results unravel the intrinsic relation between particle microstructure and the apparent diffusivity. Consequently, the modeling framework can be employed to guide the microstructure design of secondary battery particles. Furthermore, the phase-field method closes the gap between computation of diffusivities on the atomistic scale and the effective properties of secondary particles, which are a necessary input for Newman-type cell models.

Depending on the manufacturer, three different cell formats are used in the automotive sector (pouch, prismatic, and cylindrical). In the last 3 years, cylindrical cells have gained strong relevance and popularity among automotive manufacturers, mainly driven by innovative cell designs, such as the Tesla tabless design. This paper investigates 19 Li-ion cylindrical battery cells from four cell manufacturers in four formats (18650, 20700, 21700, and 4680). We aim to systematically capture the design features, such as tab design and quality parameters, such as manufacturing tolerances and generically describe cylindrical cells. We identified the basic designs and assigned example cells to them. In addition, we show a comprehensive definition of a tabless design considering the current and heat transport paths. Our findings show that the Tesla 4680 design is quasi-tabless. In addition, we found that 25% of the cathode and 30% of the anode are not notched, resulting in long electrical and thermal transport paths. Based on CT and post-mortem analyses, we show that jelly rolls can be approximated very well with the Archimedean spiral. Furthermore, we compare the gravimetric and volumetric energy density, the impedance, and the heating behavior at the surface and in the center of the jelly rolls. From the generic description, we present and discuss production processes focusing on format and design flexible manufacturing of jelly rolls. Full article"

The structural damage of the cathode material of the batteries after thermal runaway was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was found that as the state of charge (SOC) of the battery increases, the lower the temperature at which thermal runaway occurs, and the more badly the structural damage of the electrode material after thermal runaway. Qualitative analysis of products from LIBs thermal runaway emissions was conducted by GC-MS, and the toxicity and formation mechanism of the emissions were analyzed in detail. Dozens of toxic substances were detected from the emissions after thermal runaway of batteries using Li x Ni 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 and LiCoO 2 as the cathode material, the types of toxic substances increase gradually with the increase in the SOC, while as for batteries using LiFePO 4 as the cathode material, most types of toxic substances were detected from 30% SOC.

The electrocatalytic conversion of polysulfide is accelerated by ZnSe through chemical adsorption and the catalytic effect. The conductive CoSe 2 surface provides a rapid diffusion path for lithium ions, accelerating the conversion of the polysulfide. On the basis of their individual strengths, ZnSe and CoSe 2 can jointly promote the smooth adsorptive–diffuse–catalytic conversion process of polysulfide and induce the growth of lithium sulfide around its heterogeneous interface, thus enhancing the electrochemical performance of the lithium–sulfur battery cathode materials.

The spherical shape of the graphite particles has proven to be beneficial for application in electric vehicles, especially for fast charging. So far, the spheroidization of natural flake graphite is conducted by a rigid and inefficient cascade process. In this work, a scalable classifier system was used for spheroidization, and it was demonstrated that a spheroidization time of 15 min is sufficient to improve material properties and enhance electrochemical performance while maintaining high process yields of 55%. Insights into the influence of the morphology on the intrinsic and structural properties of the graphite particles and manufactured electrodes are provided. Spheroidization creates a more efficient pore network in the coating layer while reducing the internal resistance and increasing the surface area of the particles by a factor of 1.8. We demonstrate that the spherical shape improves the discharge rate capability by 1.8, and the specific charge capacity could be enhanced by more than 237% at a C-rate of 3.

In this study, NMC622 cathodes using an aluminium foam as current collector with a measured areal capacity of up to 7.6 mAh cm −2 were investigated. To this end, the infiltrated foams were densified to various thicknesses between 200 µm and 400 µm corresponding to an electrode porosity between 65% and 30%. The microstructural analysis reveals (i) the elimination of shrinking cavities and a decrease in the porosity of the infiltrated active mass, (ii) an improved contact of active mass to the current collector structure and (iii) a pronounced clogging of the surface pores. The electrochemical properties such as capacity and rate capability are correlated to the electrode’s microstructure, demonstrating that densification is necessary to improve active material utilization and volumetric capacity.

Here, it is necessary to address the losses introduced by the DC-DC converter. This paper presents a dynamic programming approach to optimize the DC-link voltage, taking into account the battery terminal voltage variation and its impact on the overall powertrain losses. We also examine the energy efficiency gains of IGBT-based and silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET-based adjustable DC-link voltage powertrains during WLTC driving cycles through PLECS and Matlab/Simulink simulations.

However, the typical state estimations are challenging due to complex and dynamic cell parameters and wide variations in usage conditions. Physics-based models need a tradeoff between accuracy and complexity due to vast parameter requirements, while machine-learning models require large training datasets and may fail when generalized to unseen scenarios. To address this issue, this paper aims to integrate the physics-based battery model and the machine learning model to leverage their respective strengths. This is achieved by applying the deep learning framework called physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to electrochemical battery modeling. The state of charge and state of health of lithium-ion cells are predicted by integrating the partial differential equation of Fick’s law of diffusion from a single particle model into the neural network training process. The results indicate that PINN can estimate the state of charge with a root mean square error in the range of 0.014% to 0.2%, while the state of health has a range of 1.1% to 2.3%, even with limited training data. Compared to conventional approaches, PINN is less complex while still incorporating the laws of physics into the training process, resulting in adequate predictions, even for unseen situations.

Hahn, Noman Butt, Pascal Vorwerk, Elena Gimadieva, Rico Tschirschwitz, Tim Rappsilber, Ulrich Krause",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9060300,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/300/pdf?version=1685522701,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/300,21,"Lithium-based batteries have the potential to undergo thermal runaway (TR), during which mixtures of gases are released. The purpose of this study was to assess the explosibility of the gaseous emission from LIBs of an NMC-based cathode during thermal runaway. In the current project, a series of pouch lithium-based battery cells was exposed to abuse conditions (thermal) to study the total amount of gases released and the composition of the gas mixture. First, the battery cells were placed in a closed vessel, and the pressure and temperature rise inside the vessel were measured. In a second step, the composition of gases was analysed using a Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. We found that the amount of released gases was up to 102 ± 4 L, with a clear dependence on the battery capacity. This study showed that the concentration of gaseous emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), ethane (C 2 H 6 ), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) increased with higher cell capacity. Of the five studied flammable gases, the maximum concentrations of carbon monoxide (16.85 vol%), methane (7.6 vol%), and ethylene (7.86 vol%) were identified to be within their explosible range. Applying Le Chatelier’s law, a calculated lower explosion limit (LEL) of 7% in volume fraction was obtained for the gas mixture. The upper explosion limit (UEL) of the gas mixture was also found to be 31% in volume. A filter comprising pyrobubbles was used for the removal of the studied gas components released during the thermal abuse. The investigation revealed that the pyrobubbles filter was highly effect in the removal of HCN (up to 94% removal) and CO 2 (up to 100% removal). Herein, we report the dependency of the method of thermal runaway trigger on the measured maximum temperature. Full article"

The aim was to improve the electrochemical performance as suppress dendrite formation and volume change on the Li metal electrode. A LiCl/Li 13 In 3 composite film was deposited on the surface of Li powder particles using a facile liquid treatment method. The coated Li powder was mixed with Cu powder to produce a Li–Cu composite electrode (LCE) for LMSBs. It has been proven through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and analysis of the coating layer using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and depth profile analysis that LiCl/Li 13 In 3 has formed well on the surface of the Li powder. The coated LCE exhibited improved electrochemical properties in both the symmetric cell and full cell tests. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, it has been determined that after 50 cycles, the impedance of the coated LCE is 98 Ω. In particular, even when a large amount of Li was used (40%, 1544 mAh g −1 ), it exhibited improved electrochemical behavior over 50 cycles in a symmetric cell test. In addition, in a full cell test with LiV 3 O 8 as a cathode at a 2 C rate, the capacity retention was 96% after 50 cycles. SEM images showed that dendrite growth and volume change were suppressed by the novel electrode architecture. Full article"

Experimental tomography techniques to investigate the microstructure during electrode development is costly and time consuming. To address this issue, a numerical method is presented to create a digital morphology to realize a realistic microstructure. In this study, the spherical harmonics in a straightforward mathematical approach are proposed to develop the virtual 3D morphology of the electrode’s heterogeneous structure. The introduced method offers a numerically light procedure which enables effective iterative virtual testing and optimization. The generated morphology model is parameterized to reproduce a NMC cathode microstructure observed in the literature. The electrode model allows evaluation of the spatially resolved geometric, transport and electric potential characteristics of the microstructure. The computed characteristics are employed to improve the parametrization of the continuum model as the most widely used physics-based model. For this purpose, the electrochemical impedance spectra of a lithium foil/separator/NMC half-cell is virtually modeled by heterogeneous and continuum approaches. Then, the modified continuum model is compared to the heterogeneous model as a benchmark, in terms of the kinetics and transport characteristics underlying the electrochemical impedance spectra. The modified continuum model shows an improved response in both frequency and time domains. Full article"
A Systematic Review on Lithium-Ion Battery Disassembly Processes for Efficient Recycling,"Shubiao Wu, Nicolaj Kaden, Klaus Dröder",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9060297,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/297/pdf?version=1685354970,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/6/297,39,"Recycling plays a crucial role in achieving a sustainable production chain for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), as it reduces the demand for primary mineral resources and mitigates environmental pollution caused by improper disposal. Disassembly of the LIBs is typically the preliminary step preceding chemical recovery operations, facilitating early separation of components consisting of different materials. Despite that extensive research has been conducted on the chemical processes involved in the recycling of LIBs, systematic studies on disassembly processes in the recycling process are relatively scarce. In this research, a systematic review was conducted on the publications from major databases, such as Scopus, SpringerLink, and others, to explore the current state of disassembly processes in LIBs’ recycling. The results emphasize disassembly as a crucial process for achieving a high material separation rate and ensuring a high degree of purity of the recycled active material. Moreover, automated disassembly can significantly raise productivity and reduce disassembly costs. Thus, it improves disassembly efficiency and increases economic as well as environmental benefits. Most researchers have focused on disassembly at the pack or module level. Investigation into extending the disassembly depth from cell to individual components is limited, particularly in automated approaches. Therefore, further research is highly recommended to explore the feasibility and potential of novel automated disassembly procedures at the cell level. This can contribute to improving the efficiency and sustainability of the recycling process for LIBs. Full article"

Here, a novel Fe 3 C-decorated folic acid-derived graphene-like N-doped carbon sheet (Fe 3 C@N-CS) was successfully prepared as the polysulfide catalyst to modify the separator of Li-S batteries. The porous layered structures can successfully capture polysulfide as a physical barrier and the encapsulated Fe 3 C catalyst can effectively trap and catalyze the conversion of polysulfide, thus accelerating the redox reaction kinetics. Together with the highly conductive networks, a cell with the Fe 3 C@N-CS-modified separator evinces superior cycling stability with 0.06% capacity decay per cycle at 1 C rate over 500 cycles and excellent specific capacity with an initial capacity of 1260 mAh g −1 at 0.2 C.

Herein, we synthesized a series of well-designed yolk-shelled Fe 3 O 4 @carbon (YS-Fe 3 O 4 @C) nanocavities with different proportions of Fe 3 O 4 as efficient sulfur hosts to stabilize polysulfide intermediates. The yolk-shelled nanocavity architectures were prepared through a facile method, which could effectively confine the active materials and achieve high conductivity. The polysulfide intermediate shuttle was successfully suppressed by a physiochemical synergism effect combining the retention of carbon shells and the adsorption of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle cores. The highly conductive carbon shell provides efficient pathways for fast electron transportation. Meanwhile, the visible evolution of active materials and a reversible electrochemical reaction are revealed by in situ X-ray diffraction. With the balanced merits of enhanced electrical conductivity of carbon shell and optimal adsorption of Fe 3 O 4 cores, the S/YS-27Fe 3 O 4 @C cathode (Fe 3 O 4 accounts for 27 wt% in YS-Fe 3 O 4 @C) had the best electrochemical performance, exhibiting a high reversible specific capacity of 731.9 mAh g −1 and long cycle performance at 1 C (capacity fading rate of 0.03% over 200 cycles).

This paper designed an anode potential observer and a plating-free charging scheme for a battery module to avoid the risk of lithium plating for all cells in the module. The observer was designed using an electrochemical cell model and an electrical busbar model to estimate the anode potential of all cells within a parallel connected battery module. Due to its simplicity and low computational loads, the observer was easy to implement in a charge management system. The results demonstrated that the designed observer and charging scheme can accurately estimate the anode potential of all cells in the module. The estimation results of the observer were used in the plating-free charging scheme. Compared to conventional charging methods, the proposed scheme added an additional stage to estimate and control the anode potential, therefore reducing the risk of lithium plating during charging. It also reduced the peak temperature of the battery by approximately 9.8% and reduced the overall charging time by 18%. Full article"

The dry-press method was adopted to fabricate composite cathodes. The hG, a conductive and lightweight scaffold derived from graphene, served as a matrix to host sulfur and FNPs for the fabrication of solvent-free composites. Raman spectra confirmed the dominant hG framework for all the composites, with strong D, G, and 2D bands. The surface morphology of the fabricated cathode system showed a homogeneous distribution of FNPs throughout the composites, confirmed by the EDAX spectra. The observed Li + ion diffusion coefficient for the composite cathode started at 2.17 × 10 −16 cm 2 /s (S 25 (CBhG) 65 PVDF 10 ) and reached up to the highest value (4.15 × 10 −15 cm 2 /s) for S 25 BNTFC 5 (CBhG) 60 PVDF 10 . The best discharge capacity values for the S 25 (CBhG) 65 PVDF 10 and S 25 BNTFC 5 (CBhG) 60 PVDF 10 composites started at 1123 mAh/g s and 1509 mAh/g s and dropped to 612 mAh/g s and 572 mAh/g s , respectively, after 100 cycles; similar behavior was exhibited by the other composites that were among the best. These are better values than those previously reported in the literature. The incorporation of ferroelectric nanoparticles in the cathodes of Li-S batteries reduced the rapid formation of polysulfides due to their internal electric fields. The areal capacity for the S 25 (CBhG) 65 PVDF 10 composites was 4.84 mAh/cm 2 with a mass loading of 4.31 mg s /cm 2 , while that for the S 25 BNTFC 5 (CBhG) 60 PVDF 10 composites was 6.74 mAh/cm 2 with a mass loading of 4.46 mg s /cm 2 .

However, side reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface deteriorate the electrochemical performance and limit the commercialization of ASSBs. Surface coating of the cathode is an efficient approach for overcoming this issue. In this study, new Li 3 BO 3 (LBO)-Li 3 PO 4 (LPO) composites were applied as coating materials for high-Ni cathodes (NCM). PO 4 -based materials (such as LPO) have been used as coating layers because of their good chemical stability in sulphide electrolytes. However, the ionic conductivity of LPO is slightly insufficient compared to those of generally used ternary oxides. The addition of LBO could compensate for the low ionic conductivity of LPO and may provide better protection against sulphide electrolytes owing to the effect of LBO, which has been used as a good coating material. As expected, the LBO-LPO composites (LBPO) NCM exhibited superior discharge capacity, rate capability, and cyclic performance compared to the pristine and LPO-coated NCMs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses confirmed that the LBPO coating on the cathodes successfully suppressed the byproduct formation and an undesirable interfacial layer, which are attributed to interfacial side reactions. This result clearly shows the potential of the LBPO coating as an excellent buffer layer to stabilise the oxide cathode/sulphide electrolyte interface. Full article"

The present study is grounded on the utilization of an electrochemical fast-charging model for the purpose of determining the temperature limits for lithium deposition. A proposed approach for enhancing the charging strategy involves the consideration of discharging pulses and pulse widths, and the utilization of a genetic algorithm based on the lithium deposition boundary. The present approach endeavors to enhance the duration of charging and minimize the occurrence of irreversible thermal effects by employing the existing threshold as a safeguard threshold. The outcomes of the experiment indicate that the electrochemical rapid charging approach proposed in this study exhibits a significant level of simulation precision when subjected to high magnification and a wide range of temperatures. Furthermore, the implementation of an enhanced genetic algorithm-based optimized charging strategy has demonstrated the capability to efficiently balance the charging duration and irreversible heat, leading to a significant improvement in the charging performance in comparison to the conventional 1 C constant current charging approach.

This structure was still maintained after LiI addition. The current measured at constant applied DC voltage indicated that (80Li 2 S − 20AlI 3 )·yLiI composites are intrinsically pure Li-ion conductors. The ionic conductivity at 25 °C of y = 10 was about 2.3 × 10 −4 Scm −1 , which was about three times higher than that of y = 0. The conductivity of y = 10 increased 20 times to 2.2 × 10 −3 Scm −1 at 70 °C. These values were highest among those observed from Li 2 S-based materials. It was revealed that Li-ion moves in 80Li 2 S − 20AlI 3 by a hoping mechanism, while the lattice dipoles are the origin of Li-ion movement in (80Li 2 S − 20AlI 3 )·yLiI. The polarization measurements using Liǀ90 (80Li 2 S − 20AlI 3 )·10LiI ǀLi and LiǀLi 6 PS 5 Clǀ90 (80Li 2 S − 20AlI 3 )·10LiIǀLi 6 PS 5 ClǀLi cells proved that 90 (80Li 2 S − 20AlI 3 )·10LiI reacts with Li metal, but it is relatively stable at a low voltage.

To improve the battery thermal performance under high ambient temperature and discharge rate, a battery thermal management system (BTMS) based on honeycomb-structured liquid cooling and phase change materials (PCM) is innovatively proposed. In this paper, the thermal characteristics of INR18650/25P battery are studied theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, the influence of structure, material and operating parameters are studied based on verifying the simplified BTMS model. The results show that the counterflow, honeycomb structure of six cooling tubes and fins, 12% expanded graphite mass fraction and 25 mm battery spacing give a better battery thermal performance with high group efficiency. The maximum temperature and temperature difference in the battery in the optimal BTMS are 45.71 °C and 4.4 °C at the 40 °C environment/coolant, as against 30.4 °C and 4.97 °C at the 23.6 °C environment/coolant, respectively. Precooling the coolant can further reduce the maximum battery temperature in high temperature environments, and the precooling temperature difference within 5 °C could meet the uniformity requirements. Furthermore, this study can provide guidance for the design and optimization of BTMS under harsh conditions. Full article"

Contrary to conventional coulomb counting, the proposed method does not require an external resistive shunt; it instead only requires voltage measurements performed on the battery under test while it is operating. The current is measured indirectly using the battery’s equivalent series resistance (ESR). The method consists of a preliminary calibration phase where the ESR and the open-circuit voltage of the battery are measured for different SOCs and stored in look-up tables (LUTs). Then, in the subsequent operational phase, the method uses these LUTs together with the measured voltage at the battery terminals to estimate the SOC. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a sample lithium polymer (LiPo) battery, using a realistic current profile derived from the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). The results of this experimental evaluation demonstrate a SOC estimation root-mean-square error of 0.82% and a maximum SOC error of 1.45%. These results prove that the proposed method is feasible in a practical scenario. Full article"
Systematic Workflow for Efficient Identification of Local Representative Elementary Volumes Demonstrated with Lithium-Ion Battery Cathode Microstructures,"Benjamin Kellers, Martin P.

Current approaches define REVs only based on their size as the smallest volume in a heterogeneous material independent of its location and under certain aspects representing the same material at the continuum scale. However, the determination of such REVs is computationally expensive and time-consuming, as many costly simulations are often needed. Therefore, presented here is an efficient, systematic, and predictive workflow for the identification of REVs. The main differences from former studies are: (1) An REV is reinterpreted as one specificsub-volume of minimal size at a certain location that reproduces the relevant continuum properties of the full microstructure. It is therefore called a local REV (lREV) here. (2) Besides comparably cheap geometrical and statistical analyses, no further simulations are needed. The minimum size of the sub-volume is estimated using the simple statistical properties of the full microstructure. Then, the location of the REV is identified solely by evaluating the structural properties of all possible candidates in a very fast, efficient, and systematic manner using a penalty function. The feasibility and correct functioning of the workflow were successfully tested and validated by simulating diffusive transport, advection, and electrochemical properties for an lREV. It is shown that the lREVs identified using this workflow can be significantly smaller than typical REVs. This can lead to significant speed-ups for any pore-scale simulations. The workflow can be applied to any type of heterogeneous material, even though it is showcased here using a lithium-ion battery cathode. Full article"

Moreover, capacitive energy storage processes play a crucial role in lithium (Li) storage, especially during high scan rates. The significant contribution of capacitance is highly advantageous for the rapid transfer of Li + ions, which ultimately results in an improved reversible capacity and prolonged cycle stability of the battery. A high specific capacity of 1367 mAh g −1 was maintained over 300 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g −1 , indicating excellent capacity retention and an extended cycle life.

Nevertheless, chemical corrosion and dendrite growth occurring on Zn anodes during the charge–discharge process, which often cause surface passivation and short circuit of cells, seriously hindering the development of ZIBs. To solve these problems, a Cu(II) and polydopamine co-modified glass fiber (Cu(II)-PDA/GF) is designed as separator. On one hand, the modification of PDA enhances ionic conductivity and the water absorbing capability of a glass fiber separator due to the presence of functional groups. On the other hand, the pre-deposition of Cu on Zn anodes enables the uniform nucleation of Zn during the initial deposition process. Due to the synergistic effect, reversible zinc plating/striping is achieved in symmetric cells, which display a long lifecycle of over 1800 h at the current density of 1 mA cm −2 and with a fixed capacity of 1 mAh cm −2 . Moreover, the assembled Zn//V 2 O 5 cells using the Cu(II)-PDA/GF separator also demonstrate improved capacity retention. This study provides a simple and effective separator modification strategy for high-performance and reliable ZIBs, which are conducive to other metal-based energy storage devices. Full article"

Recently, the proliferation of battery big data and cloud computing advancements has led to the development of a new generation of BMSs, named Cloud BMS (CBMS), aiming to improve the performance and safety of BESSs. The CBMS is a cyber-physical system with connectivity between the physical BMS and a cloud-based virtual BMS, which is realized through a communication channel such as Internet of Things. Compared to the traditional BMS, the CBMS offers significantly higher computational resources, leveraging the implementation of advanced digital twin models and best-in-class algorithms in the BMS software, which will provide superior performances. However, as for any other CPS, the CBMS creates vulnerabilities against cyberattacks and if not properly secured, could end up damaging the BESS and/or causing dangerous, expensive, and life-threatening situations. Cybersecurity of the CBMSs has thus become a trending topic and several works have been published in this area in recent years. This paper conducts a scoping review to address different topics related to BMS cybersecurity. The CBMS architecture is presented, and the potential cyberattack surfaces are identified. Different possible attack scenarios, including attack points, attack types, and their impact at the component level (BMS and BESS) and system level (vehicle or grid), are discussed.

In this process, the new properties of a battery-electric powertrain lead to a different set of central requirements, such as increasing the range, lifetime or the fast-charging capability of the vehicle battery. This paper develops a bottom-up systematic model to assess the current and future impact of different battery technologies on vehicle costs. For this purpose, it summarises the scientific findings of automotive battery cell chemistries and, flanked by novel expert interviews and teardown data, derives key values for them. Based on the data obtained, modelling is carried out to demonstrate the technical and economic suitability of the identified cell chemistries and their impact on the range and total cost of electric vehicles. Lithium iron phosphate batteries appear to be able to achieve a price saving of up to 21% in the small vehicle segment compared to nickel-rich cell chemistries, provided that customers are prepared to accept a reduced range. At the same time, further efficiency improvements of the powertrain lead us to expect that, in combination with future high-energy cells, ranges of more than 800 km can be achieved even in the mid-size vehicle segment.

While phase change materials are frequently employed in battery thermal management systems, it’s important to address the concerns related to their leakage and flammability, as they can pose hazards to the safety performance of batteries. This paper proposes a novel flame retardant composite phase change material (CPCM) consisting of paraffin, high-density polyethylene, expanded graphite, ammonium polyphosphate, red phosphorus, and zinc oxide. The performance of CPCMs containing different ratios of flame retardants is investigated, and their effects when applied to battery thermal management systems are compared. The results demonstrate that the leakage rate of the flame retardant CPCMs is maintained within 1%, indicating excellent flame retardant performance and thermal management efficiency. The combination of ammonium polyphosphate and red phosphorus in the flame retardant exhibits effective synergistic effects, while zinc oxide may help phosphate compounds create their bridging bonds, which would then make it possible to construct a char layer that would separate heat and oxygen. Under a 2C discharge rate, the maximum temperature of the battery pack remains below 50 °C, and the temperature difference can be controlled within 5 °C. Even under a 3C discharge rate, the maximum temperature and temperature difference are reduced by 30.31% and 29.53%, respectively. Full article"

Many studies have focused on new structures and the electrochemical performance, but only a few investigated the particulate properties in detail. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the impact of Si content (5, 10, 15 wt.%) and particle size (120, 160, 250 nm) of core–shell structured Si@Gr composites on particulate and electrode properties was conducted. It was shown that both parameters had significant impact on the specific surface area (SSA) of particles, which was later correlated to the initial capacities and coulombic efficiencies (ICEs). Furthermore, changes in pore size distribution and electrical conductivity were found. The built full cells showed high initial capacities (>150 mAh g −1 ), good rate capability (75% at 1 C, 50% at 2 C) and ICEs (>80%). The energy density was found to increase by 32% at 15 wt.% Si compared to graphite (Gr), indicating the future potential of Si. In addition, the impact of a carbon coating was investigated (Si@Gr/C), which led to a reduction in SSA, improved particle stability and higher capacity retention. Consequently, this study emphasizes the importance of also investigating the particulate properties of Si anodes. Full article"

The high energy density, long cycle life, and low self-discharge rate of lithium-ion batteries make them an ideal choice for EVs. Recently, these batteries have been prone to faster decay in life span, leading to sudden failure of the battery. To avoid uncertainty among EV users with sudden battery failures, a robust health monitoring and prediction scheme is required for the EV battery management system. In this regard, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)-based technique has been developed for accurate and reliable prediction of battery health status. The UKF approximates nonlinearity using a set of sigma points and propagates them via the nonlinear function to enhance battery health estimation accuracy. Furthermore, the UKF-based health estimation scheme considers the state of charge (SOC) and internal resistance of the battery. Here, the UKF-based health prediction technique is compared with the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) scheme. The robustness of the UKF and EKF-based health prognostic techniques were studied under varying initial SOC values. Under these abrupt changing conditions, the proposed UKF technique performed effectively in terms of state of health (SOH) prediction. Accurate SOH determination can help EV users to decide when the battery needs to be replaced or if adjustments need to be made to extend its life. Ultimately, accurate and reliable battery health estimation is essential in vehicular applications and plays a pivotal role in ensuring lithium-ion battery sustainability and minimizing environmental impacts.

As the demand is continuously increasing, it puts a lot of strain on the battery raw material supply chains. Likewise, the large quantity of spent LIBs from different sources will add to the complexity of end-of-life (EoL) management. Battery recycling processing is a potential source of critical cathode precursor materials as an alternative to virgin raw material sourcing. Indeed, metal sulfates (nickel, cobalt, and manganese) and lithium carbonate could be recovered through EoL processing. This study aims to provide an economic and environmental life cycle sustainability assessment of recycled battery materials. This assessment is based on a bottom-up approach considering geographical boundaries and process data inputs. The two sources of critical cathode battery materials, virgin and recycled battery materials, are compared based on economic and environmental indicators. This study identified the province of Quebec in Canada as the geographical boundary where several battery processing plants have been recently announced. The best available recycling process (hydrometallurgy) was selected. For the virgin materials, this study considers the option of importing from other jurisdictions by using global average supply chain values. Furthermore, a comparison of alternative supply chain configurations was performed using a spatially differentiated approach. The main findings of this study are as follows: (i) the environmental credit of recycled cathode active materials (CAMs) is estimated as −6.46 kg CO 2e /kg CAM, and (ii) the overall cost and environmental impacts of producing LIB cathode active material from recycled battery materials can be 48% and 54% lower than production from virgin materials, respectively, considering the upstream, midstream, and downstream stages of the CAM supply chain. The main drivers for the reduction in these financial costs and emissions are the local transportation and the hydrometallurgical process. The assessment results provide insights to support the development of appropriate policies and R&D solutions adapted to local considerations as well as offer additional possibilities to improve the design of sustainable supply chains for LIB recycling.

However, their performance is significantly compromised at low operating temperatures, which may happen in cold climatic conditions. The loss of performance can be attributed to reduced kinetics and decreased diffusivity of ions in the electrolyte. In this paper, we present a physics-based electrochemical model of a vanadium redox flow battery that allows temperature-related corrections to be incorporated at a fundamental level, thereby extending its prediction capability to low temperatures. The model follows the conventional evaluation of the cell overpotential as the sum of contributions from overpotentials associated with activation, ionic conduction and mass transfer polarization. New data-driven models have been proposed to make these sub-models temperature sensitive. The overall model has been validated with a wide range of data from VRFB cells of sizes up to 900 cm 2 and operating temperatures down to −10 °C. The model results indicate that enhancement of electrochemical performance of VRFB below subzero temperatures requires electrode and membrane activation and improvement in ionic conductivity of the electrolyte.

It is shown that the dependence of the capacity on the current density Q(j) follows Peukert’s law, which is characterized by a low value of Peukert’s exponents in the region of low currents and a high value of the exponents in the region of high currents. Peukert’s exponent for the anode-free cell remains constant through the entire range of current density variation. A model for SSLIB capacity based on the balance of ion (diffusion and drift) and electron currents is proposed. The model predicts a Q(j) dependence well approximating the experimental results and fitting Peukert’s law.

The TP model introduces an RC link, whose time constant varies with changes in the battery operating status to represent the fast build-up and slow relaxation of the polarization voltage. Specifically, such an RC link evolves into an RLC parallel link during charging to reveal the overshoot characteristic. In this way, the external characteristics of LFP batteries, considering the complex phase transition process, are simulated by a simple equivalent circuit. Constant-current pulse tests are performed to verify the proposed model. For application, a state-of-charge (SOC) estimation is implemented on the basis of the TP model, with the use of a transformed cubature Kalman Filter (TCKF). The experimental results show that the TP model is able to represent the dynamic and static characteristics, as well as estimate the SOC of an LFP battery with a good accuracy. Full article"
Method for Benchmarking Li Metal Anodes: A Mandatory Step toward Reliable Lithium Metal Batteries,"Nicolas Delaporte, Alexis Perea, Mireille Léonard, Julie Matton, Hendrix Demers, Steve Collin-Martin, David Rozon, Daniel Clément, Abdelbast Guerfi, Chisu Kim",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9070368,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/7/368/pdf?version=1688813030,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/7/368,1,"All-solid-state batteries are known to be the new energy storage holy grail that will lead to safer batteries with higher energy density than current Li-ion batteries. The use of a solid electrolyte enables the use of lithium metal as the anode material. However, its composition, its thickness, and the quality/nature of its passivation layer can strongly affect the performance of the battery. For this reason, we propose a simple benchmarking method that evaluates and compares the quality and electrochemical performance of various Li anodes. This method can be easily reproduced, especially concerning the electrochemical evaluation that uses a commercial liquid electrolyte and the widely spread coin-cell format. In total, ~285 coin cells were assembled to benchmark our in-house lithium metal foil (Lithium HQ) with two commercial ones and the results showed the superior performance of our Li metal anode. The performance of the cells seems closely related to the quality and uniformity of the Li surface. In addition, we propose including in the benchmarking method the effect of Li aging in a dry room on the electrochemical performance. This effect is important to consider because the fabrication of all-solid-state batteries is conducted in such an environment. Full article"

However, efficient use of photovoltaic power independently of other energy sources can only be accomplished employing batteries. The ever-growing demand for the stationary storage of volatile renewable energy poses new challenges in terms of cost, resource availability and safety. The development of Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIB) has been tremendously pushed by the mobile phone industry and the current need for high-voltage traction batteries. This path of global success is primarily based on its high energy density. Due to changing requirements, other aspects come to the fore that require a rebalancing of different technologies in the “Battery Ecosystem”. In this paper we discuss the evolution of zinc and manganese dioxide-based aqueous battery technologies and identify why recent findings in the field of the reaction mechanism and the electrolyte make rechargeable Zn-MnO 2 batteries (ZMB), commonly known as so-called Zinc-Ion batteries (ZIB), competitive for stationary applications. Finally, a perspective on current challenges for practical application and concepts for future research is provided. This work is intended to classify the current state of research on ZMB and to highlight the further potential on its way to the market within the “Battery Ecosystem”, discussing key parameters such as safety, cost, cycle life, energy and power density, material abundancy, sustainability, modelling and cell/module development.

In this work, we suggest a theoretical study and strategy for improving the low-temperature resistance of LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) pouch cells, by introducing a photothermal conversion layer composed of copper and single-walled carbon nanotubes. A three-dimensional electrochemical–thermal coupling model for a lithium manganate battery is established, in which the photothermal conversion layer is attached on the surface of the cathode collector, and the effect of lug design is also discussed. The changes in the battery temperature field, and improvements in electrochemical performance before and after light preheating, are analyzed. The results show that, when the photothermal conversion film is applied, the LMO pouch cell’s temperature rises 2.7 °C/min in a −5 °C environment, and the surface-temperature averaging is improved. The concentration of lithium embedded in the anode is significantly increased, and the charging speed is enhanced by 20%. The batteries with a single-sided lug design exhibit better performance compared with those with a two-sided lug design. Validation of the presented model is performed, by comparing it with the experimental Panasonic UF653445ST commercial battery datasheet. This work provides theoretical guidance on improving the low-temperature performance of pouch cells, based on the photothermal conversion method. Full article"

It also addresses the challenge of eliminating the time-consuming activation procedure, which limits the applications of Mn 3 O 4 cathodes. The new approach is based on the use of environmentally friendly and biocompatible pH modifiers–dispersants, such as polyethylenimine (PEI) and meglumine (MG) for hydrothermal synthesis. In this approach, the use of inorganic alkalis is avoided. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach for the fabrication of manganese oxide nanoparticles, such as Mn-PEI and Mn-MG. Electrodes with a high active mass of 40 mg cm −2 are fabricated and electrochemically tested in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The method of electrode material fabrication offers benefits for the accelerated electrode activation procedure, which is practically eliminated for Mn-MG electrodes. The Mn-MG electrodes showed a remarkably high capacitance of 3.68 F cm −2 (93.19 F g −1 ) at a sweep rate of 100 mV s −1 and a high capacitance retention of 90.6% in the CV sweep range of 1–100 mV s −1 .

They often focus on a battery cell’s state of charge (SOC) or state of health (SOH). Therefore, this paper introduces, on the one hand, a new lithium-ion battery dataset with dynamic validation data over degradation and, on the other hand, a model-based SOC and SOH estimation based on this dataset as a reference. An unscented Kalman-filter-based approach was used for SOC estimation and extended with a holistic ageing model to handle the SOH estimation. The paper describes the dataset, the models, the parameterisation, the implementation of the state estimations, and their validation using parts of the dataset, resulting in SOC and SOH estimations over the entire battery life. The results show that the dataset can be used to extract parameters, design models based on it, and validate it with dynamically degraded battery cells.

Constructing edge-nitrogen-rich carbon skeleton with highly exposed active sites and efficient charge transfer is critical for the high performance of nitrogen-doped carbonaceous anode materials. Herein, a kind of ultrahigh edge-nitrogen (up to 16.2 at%) doped carbon nanosheets (ENCNS) has been developed by an efficient assembly of high-nitrogen-ratio melamine (MA) with polyacrylic acid grafted graphene oxide (GO- g -PAA) molecular brushes. The assembled PAA/MA structure facilitates the formation of an edge-nitrogen-rich carbon skeleton during heat treatment, while the highly conductive graphene backbone with a 2D nanomorphology enables shortened ion diffusion pathways and numerous exposed active surfaces. As a result, the ENCNS demonstrate excellent rate performance (up to 144 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ) and good cycle stability (136 and 100 mAh g −1 after 400 cycles at 5 and 10 A g −1 , respectively).

This paper presents a method of estimating the combined state of energy (SOE) and state of charge (SOC). First, aiming to improve the accuracy of the SOE and SOC estimation, a third-order resistor-capacitance equivalent model (TRCEM) of a EULIB is established. Second, long short-term memory (LSTM) is introduced to optimize the Ohmic internal resistance (OIR), actual energy (AE), and actual capacity (AC) parameters in real time to improve the accuracy of the model. Third, in the process of the SOE and SOC estimation, the observation noise equation and process noise equation are updated iteratively to make adaptive corrections and enhance the adaptive ability. Finally, an SOE and SOC estimation method based on LSTM optimization and an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) is established. In simulation experiments, when the capacity decays to 90%, 60% and 30% of the rated capacity, regardless of whether the initial value is consistent with the actual value, the values of the SOE and SOC estimation can track the actual value with strong adaptive ability, and the estimated error is less than 1.19%, indicating that the algorithm has a high level of accuracy. The method presented in this paper provides a new perspective for estimating the SOE and SOC of a EULIB. Full article"

In this work, bimetallic flower-like NiCoP encapsulated in an N-doped carbon shell (designated as NiCoP@NC) as a high-rate capable anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) was successfully designed and synthesized. The novel structure design combines the advantages of flower-like NiCoP (core) and N-doped carbon (shell). Flower-like NiCoP offers numerous interface and redox reaction sites for improving lithium storage, while the N-doped carbon shell effectively buffers volume expansion and enhances electrical conductivity. The synergistic effect between NiCoP and the N-doped carbon shell proposes a marvelous high-rate capacity (320 mA h/g even at 5 A/g) and a good cycle life with high reversible capacity (369.8 mA h/g for 700 cycles at 3 A/g with 81% retention). An investigation of kinetics performance shows that the introduction of the N-doped carbon shell enhances the charge transfer, and the pseudocapacitive behavior dominates the rapid Li + storage of the NiCoP@NC electrode.

Finally, it clarifies the role of manufacturing scrap as the domestic U.S. supply chain is built up. It concludes that recycling will be important in the long term, but growth still requires that new material be extracted to supply additional material. Full article"

While typical flow frame designs usually assume all parts are standard, the industry can suffer from irregularity and manufacturing tolerances of cell components, such as the shape or dimensions of the flow frame and porous electrode. This paper evaluates the impact of side gaps and porosity differences of the graphite felt due to irregularity and manufacturing tolerances on the electrolyte flow in the active cell areas. A three-dimensional hydraulic model with parameterised multi-cell stack geometry has been developed in COMSOL to compare the cell velocity distributions and pressure losses of a vanadium redox flow battery with flow-through electrodes. The results indicate that the side gaps and porosity segments can result in preferential flow within low-resistance areas, leading to significantly lower flow rates for other cell areas compared with standard flow frames. Proposed countermeasures of adjusting channel locations and applying dimples protruding into the cell cavity from the flow frame show good potential to avoid stagnant zones and maintain theoretical flow rates for the active cell areas.

However, the commonly used model-based, data-driven, or experiment-based methods struggle to independently achieve accurate SOC estimation under different working conditions and temperatures, which affects battery performance and safety. To this end, this paper proposes an online SOC estimation method that combines the model-driven and double-data-driven approaches. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based on the first-order RC model is used to achieve robust SOC estimation, while the data-driven long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to achieve fast SOC estimation. The former model has an excellent dynamic performance and the latter has high steady-state accuracy. The SOC estimation results are input into the SOC estimation model of series LSTM so that the stable but inaccurate SOC values estimated by UKF in the first part and the accurate but fluctuating SOC values estimated by LSTM can be correlated and corrected, achieving a fast and accurate SOC estimation under various working conditions. The estimation results show that the above method has strong robustness and high accuracy, and effectively reduces model complexity and data redundancy. In addition, the root mean square error of SOC estimation under different working conditions is controlled within 1–2.3% at 0 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C, which is better than the traditional single-SOC estimation method.

The physicochemical characterization results reveal hierarchical porous nanostructure morphology with agglomerated particles and a 20 to 25 nm dimension range. Moreover, the sample has a high specific surface area (~65 m 2 g −1 ) and pore volume (0.135 cm 3 g −1 ).

In order to increase insight into these processes, we report the development of a pseudo-three-dimensional (P3D) thermo-electro-mechanical model of a commercial lithium-ion pouch cell with graphite negative electrode and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide/lithium cobalt oxide blend positive electrode. Nonlinear molar volumes of the active materials as function of lithium stoichiometry are taken from literature and implemented into the open-source software Cantera for convenient coupling to battery simulation codes. The model is parameterized and validated using electrical, thermal and thickness measurements over a wide range of C-rates from 0.05 C to 10 C. The combined experimental and simulated analyses show that thickness change during cycling is dominated by intercalation-induced swelling of graphite, while swelling of the two blend components partially cancel each other. At C-rates above 2 C, electrochemistry-induced temperature increase significantly contributes to cell swelling due to thermal expansion. The thickness changes are nonlinearly distributed over the thickness of the electrode pair due to gradients in the local lithiation, which may accelerate local degradation. Remaining discrepancies between simulation and experiment at high C-rates might be attributed to lithium plating, which is not considered in the model at present. Full article"

However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Zn 2+ and the layer-structured cathodes is still a key issue that hinders the batteries from storing more Zn. Herein, we report partially nitrided and cation-doped vanadium oxide for improved Zn storage performance. Specifically, the defects and nitride species that are generated inside the material upon nitriding improve the conductivity of the material and introduce a new Zn storage mechanism. The intercalation of cations, in contrast, widens the interlayer spacing to store more Zn 2+ ions and enhances the cycling stability of the material.

Quantification of Lithium Plating in Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on Impedance Spectrum and Artificial Neural Network,"Miao Bai, Chao Lyu, Dazhi Yang, Gareth Hinds",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9070350,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/7/350/pdf?version=1688199024,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/7/350,7,"Accurate evaluation of the health status of lithium-ion batteries must be deemed as of great significance, insofar as the utility and safety of batteries are of concern. Lithium plating, in particular, is notoriously known to be a chemical reaction that can cause deterioration in, or even fatal hazards to, the health of lithium-ion batteries. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which has distinct advantages such as being fast and non-destructive over its competitors, suffices in detecting lithium plating and thus has been attracting increasing attention in the field of battery management, but its ability of assessing quantitatively the degree of lithium plating remains largely unexplored hitherto. On this point, this work seeks to narrow that gap by proposing an EIS-based method that can quantify the degree of lithium plating. The core conception is to eventually circumvent the reliance on state-of-health measurement, and use instead the impedance spectrum to acquire an estimate on battery capacity loss. To do so, the effects of solid electrolyte interphase formation and lithium plating on battery capacity must be first decoupled, so that the mass of lithium plating can be quantified. Then, based on an impedance spectrum measurement, the parameters of the fractional equivalent circuit model (ECM) of the battery can be identified. These fractional ECM parameters are received as inputs by an artificial neural network, which is tasked with establishing a correspondence between the model parameters and the mass of lithium plating. The empirical part of the work revolves around the data collected from an aging experiment, and the validity of the proposed method is truthfully attested by dismantling the batteries, which is otherwise not needed during the actual uptake of the method.

In this review, we present the recent research progress on Fe-based cathode/anode materials, which include polyanionic compounds, Prussian blue, oxides, carbides, and selenides. We also discuss the research efforts to build Fe-based ASIB full cells. Lastly, we share our perspectives on the key challenges that need to be addressed and suggest alternative directions for aqueous Na-ion batteries. We hope this review paper can promote more research efforts on the development of low-cost and low-toxicity materials for aqueous battery applications. Full article"
High Flashpoint and Eco-Friendly Electrolyte Solvent for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Marco Ströbel, Larissa Kiefer, Julia Pross-Brakhage, Jessica Hemmerling, Philipp Finster, Carlos Ziebert, Kai Peter Birke",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9070348,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/7/348/pdf?version=1687946658,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/7/348,3,"Since Sony launched the commercial lithium-ion cell in 1991, the composition of the liquid electrolytes has changed only slightly. The electrolyte consists of highly flammable solvents and thus poses a safety risk. Solid-state ion conductors, classified as non-combustible and safe, are being researched worldwide. However, they still have a long way to go before being available for commercial cells. As an alternative, this study presents glyceryl tributyrate (GTB) as a flame retardant and eco-friendly solvent for liquid electrolytes for lithium-ion cells. The remarkably high flashpoint ( T FP = 174 ° C) and the boiling point ( T BP = 287 ° C) of GTB are approximately 150 K higher than that of conventional linear carbonate components, such as ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) or diethyl carbonate (DEC). The melting point ( T MP = − 75 ° C) is more than 100 K lower than that of ethylene carbonate (EC). A life cycle test of graphite/NCM with 1 M LiTFSI dissolved in GTB:EC (85:15 wt) achieved a Coulombic efficiency of above 99.6% and the remaining capacity resulted in 97% after 50 cycles ( C / 4 ) of testing. The flashpoint of the created electrolyte is T FP = 172 ° C and, therefore, more than 130 K higher than that of state-of-the-art liquid electrolytes. Furthermore, no thermal runaway was observed during thermal abuse tests. Compared to the reference electrolyte LP40, the conductivity of the GTB-based is reduced, but the electrochemical stability is highly improved. GTB-based electrolytes are considered an interesting alternative for improving the thermal stability and safety of lithium-ion cells, especially in low power-density applications. Full article"

However, there is a lacking in the technical route analysis about the commercialization of ASSBs based on sulfide solid electrolytes. This review mainly introduces the specific preparation methods of various parts in sulfide-based ASSBs, including the preparation methods of sulfide solid electrolyte particles, sulfide-based composite electrolyte membranes, composite cathodes and anodes, and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.

In order to reduce the outflow of such foreign matter defect cells, the production line universally adopted the K -value test process. In the traditional K -value test, the detection threshold is determined empirically, which has poor dynamic characteristics and probably leads to missing or false detection. Based on comparing the screening effect of different machine learning algorithms for the production data of lithium-ion cells, this paper proposes a K -value dynamic screening algorithm for the cell production line based on the local outlier factor algorithm. The analysis results indicate that the proposed method can adaptively adjust the detection threshold. Furthermore, we validated its effectiveness through the metal foreign matter implantation experiment conducted in the pilot manufacturing line. Experiment results show that the proposed method’s detection rate is improved significantly. The increase in the detection rate of foreign matter defects is beneficial to improving battery quality and safety. Full article"

In this work, the charge storage mechanisms of the olivine-related compound (Mg 0.5 Ni 0.5 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 using Mg 2+ and Li + ions were investigated and compared for the first time when copper was chosen as the current collector. A comprehensive physicochemical and electrochemical characterization was performed on the pristine powder and electrodes at different states of charge. Although (Mg 0.5 Ni 0.5 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 is electrochemically active, it undergoes irreversible conversion reactions in both Mg and Li chemistries. The conversion reactions proceed with an ionic exchange between structural Ni 2+ and Mg 2+ or Li + cations, which results in the formation of sarcopside-Mg 3 (PO 4 ) 2 , a Cu–Ni alloy and poorly crystalline Li 3 PO 4 , respectively. A capacity of 600 mA h g −1 was achieved with a Li metal counter electrode in the Li cell since the conversion reaction could go to completion. A capacity of 92 mA h g −1 was delivered in the Mg cell using an activated carbon counter electrode. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanism of activity in olivine-related compounds, underlining the importance of performing systematic studies to unveil the complex interactions between both single-valent and multivalent ions with novel structures.

To address this challenge, a variety of two- and three-dimensional zinc anodes have been investigated. While two-dimensional zinc anodes have been extensively studied, there has been limited investigation into three-dimensional zinc anodes for hybrid-flow batteries. This study highlights the potential of three-dimensional zinc anodes to mitigate overpotentials and improve the mass transport of active species to promote negative electrode reactions. The performance of a membraneless flow battery based on low-cost zinc and organic quinone was herein evaluated using experimental and numerical approaches. Specifically, the use of zinc fiber was shown to yield an average coulombic efficiency of approximately 90% and an average voltage efficiency of approximately 82% over the course of 100 cycles at a current density of 30 mA cm −2 . These results indicate the viability of using zinc fiber anodes to improve the performance of existing hybrid-flow batteries. Full article"

This paper provides a Monte Carlo-like simulation approach to generate a reproducible, comprehensible and large dataset based on an extensive literature search on common assumptions and simulation parameters. In some cases, these assumptions are quite different from field data, as shown by comparison with experimentally determined values. Two relatively simple ISC detection methods are tested on the generated dataset and their performance is evaluated to illustrate the proposed approach. The evaluation of the detection performance by quantitative measures such as the Youden-index shows a high divergence with respect to internal and external parameters such as threshold level and cell-to-cell variations (CtCV), respectively. These results underline the importance of quantitative evaluations based on identical test data. The proposed approach is able to support this task by providing cost-effective test data generation with incorporation of known factors affecting detection quality. Full article"

The results from the cell deformation monitoring via a rectangular rosette strain gauges indicate an over-swelling process starting shortly after the cell voltage increases above 4.2 V. The acoustic ultrasound interrogation measurement and data treatment using clustering and mapping software, carried out in parallel, showed an abnormal evolution of the signals’ power density spectral patterns, suggesting changes in the structure of the cell jellyroll induced by the overcharge reactions. The increase in cell skin temperature due to the overcharge process starts considerably later.

The charge–discharge cycling of the battery was compared at different sizes and current densities, and its performance was evaluated under various mass transport and operating conditions. The results showed that the round-trip coulombic and voltage efficiencies were over 90% and 85%, respectively, for the laboratory-scale (1 cm 2 electrode) cell, but these performances tended to deteriorate with the scaled-up (1600 cm 2 electrode) cell due to inadequate mass transfer and sediment coverage of quinone, as well as the formation of a passivation film on the zinc anode.

We use hydrothermal synthesis to prepare an NMO/CNF (Carbon NanoFiber) hybrid, consisting of uniform oxide nanowires with an average width of 70 nm and length in the range of several tenths of µm. The highly dispersed CNFs impart high conductivity to the NMO/CNF electrode, allowing high-rate performance at a C-rate of up to 20 C, with a delivered capacity of more than half the theoretical value in a 1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte. Moreover, the NMO/CNF hybrid shows good electrochemical stability under several hundred cycles at a high C-rate. However, the NMO nanowire electrodes reveal a lower-than-expected capacity, probably as a result of the tendency of nanowires to form bundles, which prevents direct contact with conductive fibers and induce the under-utilization of active material. With this study, we demonstrate a strong improvement of the otherwise inherently low-rate performance of NMO through oxide nanostructuring and hybridization with carbon fibers, paving the way for further research on NMO-based materials for aqueous sodium ion storage.

Rt-LSTM to realize the joint estimation of SOC and SOH of retired lithium batteries, which relies on the LSTM neural network model and completes the correlation adaption in the spatio-temporal dimension of the whole life cycle sample data. The LSTM model is used as the base learner to construct the AdaBoost. Rt-LSTM strong learning model. The LSTM weak predictor is combined with weights to form a strong predictor, which greatly solves the problem of low accuracy of state estimation due to the large number and variability of retired batteries.

Naturally, industries have shown great interest in establishing business models for retired battery reuse and recycling. However, they still have many challenges, such as high costs from the logistics of returned batteries and evaluating returned battery quality. One of the most important characteristics of a returned battery is the battery storage capacity. Conventionally, the battery’s energy capacity is measured through the low current full charging and discharging process. While this traditional measurement procedure gives a reliable estimate of battery storage capacity, the time required for a reliable estimate is unacceptably long to support profitable business models. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to estimate battery storage capacity that can dramatically reduce the time for estimation through the partial discharging process. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, cylindrical and prismatic cells were used in the experiments. Initially, five indicators were selected from the voltage response curves that can identify battery storage capacity. Then, the five indicators were applied to principal component analysis (PCA) to extract dominant factors. The extracted factors were applied to a multiple linear regression model to produce a reliable estimation of battery storage capacity. Full article"

A hydrometallurgy recycling route with the usage of 1.5 mol/L of malic acid and 3 vol.% of H 2 O 2 as a leaching solution for cobalt extraction was chosen. The efficiency of the cobalt extraction reached 95%. The obtained material was investigated using an X-ray diffraction analysis and the EDX and SEM methods. The electrochemical behavior of the synthesized NCM111 was analyzed and compared to the commercially available material of the same type. The material demonstrated a specific discharge capacity on the first cycle of 163.7 mAh/g. The cyclic resource of the material turned out to be unsatisfactory. In addition, perspective cathode materials, such as NCM622 and NCM811, were obtained. The synthesized materials were analyzed using XRD, SEM, EDX, charge–discharge and cycle life tests, and the CVA and EIS methods. The initial specific discharge capacities of the NCM622 and NCM811 were 168 and 187 mAh/g, respectively. On the fifth cycle, the NCM622 demonstrated an increasing capacity—to 179 mAh/g, unlike NCM811, as the capacity of this material decreased to 141 mAh/g. Full article"
Electroforming as a Novel One-Step Manufacturing Method of Structured Aluminum Foil Current Collectors for Lithium-Ion Batteries,"Phillip Scherzl, Michael Kaupp, Wassima El Mofid, Timo Sörgel",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9080422,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/422/pdf?version=1691831141,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/422,3,"Conventionally, cathode current collectors for lithium-ion batteries (LIB) consist of an aluminum foil generally manufactured by a rolling process. In the present work, a novel one-step manufacturing method of structured aluminum foil current collectors for lithium-ion batteries by electroforming is introduced. For this, a low-temperature chloride-based ionic liquid was used as an electrolyte and a rotating cylinder out of stainless steel as a temporary substrate. It was shown that the structure of the aluminum foils can be adjusted from dense and flat to three-dimensional by choosing an appropriate substrate rotation speed and current density. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and white light interferometry (WLI) were utilized to analyze the foils’ surface morphology, structure and topography. The SEM analysis of the aluminum foils showed that the rolling process produced a foil with small grains, while electrodeposition resulted in foils with different degrees of grain growth and seed formation. This was in total agreement with WLI results that revealed significant differences in terms of roughness parameters, including the peak-to-valley difference R pv , the root-mean-square roughness R q and the arithmetic mean roughness R a . These were, respectively, equal to 6.8 µm, 0.35 µm and 0.279 µm for the state-of-the-art foil and up to 96.6 µm, 10.92 µm and 8.783 µm for the structured electroformed foil. Additionally, cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the aluminum foils was used to investigate their passivation behavior within the typical LIB cathode potential operation window. The strong decrease in the current density during the second cycle compared to the first cycle, where an anodic peak appeared between 4.0 and 4.4 V vs. Li/Li + , demonstrated that passivation occurs in the same manner as observed for commercial Al current collectors.

Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive and X-ray phase analysis were used as the main methods for characterizing the obtained nanostructures. A study of the morphological properties of the synthesized nanostructures revealed that the variation of the synthesis conditions results in the formation of structures with different degrees of structural ordering and morphology. During the evaluation of the phase composition of the synthesized CoZn nanostructures with variation in the applied potential differences, the phase transformations’ dynamics were established, which can be written as follows: X-ray amorphous structures → Zn/CoO 2 → Co 2 Zn 11 /Co/CoO 2 → Co 2 Zn 11 /ZnO. Using the methods of phase analysis and mapping, an isotropic distribution of phases in the composition of nanostructures was established. In such a case, the formation of the Co 2 Zn 11 phase occurs with an elevation in the concentration of cobalt from 8.9 to 29.3–31.1 at. % leads to the partial substitution of zinc ions by cobalt ions, followed by the formation of a cubic phase.

The major problem of replacing propulsion systems based on internal combustion engines with electric ones is the energy storage capacity of batteries, which defines the autonomy of the electric vehicle. Furthermore, considering the high cost of the battery, it is necessary to consider the implementation of command-and-control systems that extend the life of a battery for as long as possible. The topic covered in this article refers to the analysis by modeling and simulation of the efficiency of a hybrid energy storage system (battery–supercapacitor) adapted for an electric vehicle (e-Golf). Based on the simulations carried out, considering that the operating mode corresponds to the WLTP test cycle, the major conclusion was reached that the use of such a system leads to a decrease in energy consumption by 2.95% per 100 km. Simulations of the model were also carried out to obtain the variation in electricity consumption and vehicle autonomy depending on the number of passengers. Electricity consumption if the vehicle is equipped with a hybrid energy storage system increases by 0.67% on average for each passenger (of 75 kg) added and by 0.73% on average if the vehicle is not equipped with supercapacitors. Moreover, the use of the supercapacitor’s properties leads to the reduction in the peaks in energy taken/given by the battery with a direct effect on extending its life. Full article"

Factories use a lot of electrical and thermal energy to manufacture products, but only a small percentage is recycled. Utilizing energy storage systems in industrial facilities is being applied as a way to cut energy costs and reduce carbon emissions. However, lithium-based batteries, which are predominantly used in traditional industries, face challenges in terms of affordability and reliability. Redox flow batteries, on the other hand, offer high power output and reliability, and are economical to manufacture for installations with high capacity. Although redox flow batteries are difficult to use in general electrical systems due to their small volume-to-capacity ratio, they can be easily utilized as energy storage devices in industrial parks or renewable energy parks with relatively little space constraints. In addition, since factories use a lot of heat energy in addition to electricity, utilizing combined heat and power can further reduce heat energy. In this study, we analyzed the cost estimation and economic feasibility of utilizing photovoltaics, redox flow cells, and combined heat and power to save energy in a factory’s energy management system.

However, existing safety assessment models lack the implementation of SOC-dependent thickness variations referred to as reversible swelling. Reversible swelling affects the applied preload force on a constrained pouch cell, potentially impacting its safety. To investigate this, a finite element RVE model was developed in LS-Dyna. Two swelling models, simplified homogenous expansion (HE) and locally resolved expansion (LE), were implemented along with a reference basis model (BM) without expansion. Six different stress- or strain-based short circuit criteria were calibrated with abuse test simulations at different SOCs and preload forces. Short circuit prognosis improved on average by 0.8% and 0.7% for the LE and HE model compared to the BM, with minimum principal stress being the most suitable criterion. The LE model exhibited a softer mechanical response than the HE model or BM, accounting for the pouch cell surface unevenness at small indentations. This study demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of implementing an expansion model in a commercial FE solver for improved short circuit predictions. An expansion model is crucial for simulating aged battery cells with significant geometry changes strongly affecting the preload force of a constrained battery cell. Full article"

The vehicle must cross several consecutive regions, with each region containing different types of charging nodes. A charging node has to be selected in each region, and the reward for visiting each node—in terms of a ‘satisfactory’ charging process—is a binary random variable that depends upon dynamic factors such as the type of charging node, weather conditions, congestion, battery status, etc. To learn how to efficiently operate in this dynamic environment, a hybrid methodology combining simulation with reinforcement learning is proposed. The reinforcement learning component is able to make informed decisions at each stage, while the simulation component is employed to validate the learning process. The computational experiments show how the proposed methodology is capable of design routing plans that are significantly better than non-informed decisions, thus allowing for an efficient management of the vehicle’s battery under such dynamic conditions.

This paper proposes a novel sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) prediction method for LIB capacity degradation based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network with the attention mechanism. An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is developed for automatic hyperparameter search of the Seq2Seq model, which speeds up parameter convergence and avoids getting stuck in local optima. Before model training, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm decomposes the capacity degradation sequences. And the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components with the highest correlation are employed to reconstruct the sequences, reducing the influence of noise in the original data. A real-cycle-life data set under fixed operating conditions is employed to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the method. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms traditional GRU and RNN models. The predicted mean absolute percent error (MAPE) in SOH evaluation and RUL prediction can be as low as 0.76% and 0.24%, respectively. Full article"

Our findings demonstrate that rGO sheets improve cycling performance in NFP/C/rGO composite in the absence of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)-stabilizing additives. However, once SEI is stabilized with the help of fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte additive, NFP with carbon additive (NFP/C) exhibits a superior electrochemical performance when compared to NFP/rGO and NFP/C/rGO composites. The decreases in capacity and rate capability are proportional to the amount of rGO added, and lead to an increase in overvoltage and internal resistance. Based on our results, we attribute this effect to worsened sodium kinetics in the bulk of the electrode—the larger ionic radius of Na + hinders charge transfer in the presence of rGO, despite the likely improved electronic conductivity. These findings provide a compelling explanation for the observed trends in electrochemical performance and suggest that the use of rGO in Na-ion battery electrodes may present challenges associated with ionic transport along and through rGO sheets.

The results are compared to cells that are free to expand with gas evolution. It is shown that applying compression to the cells not only results in a greater reproducibility of the experiments but that it also affects the thermal runaway process itself. With decreasing clamping stresses, the reaction time of the thermal runaway is increased by up to 19%, and the mass ejection is decreased by up to 10%, which, in turn, strongly influences the measurable gas concentrations by up to 80%. Based on this, a defined clamping compression was selected to obtain comparable results for different cell formats. Full article"
Facile Constructing Hierarchical Fe3O4@C Nanocomposites as Anode for Superior Lithium-Ion Storage,"Haichang Zhong, Wenlong Huang, Yukun Wei, Xin Yang, Chunhai Jiang, Hui Liu, Wenxian Zhang, Chu Liang, Leyang Dai, Xijun Xu",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9080403,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/403/pdf?version=1691132679,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/403,6,"Ferroferric oxide (Fe 3 O 4 ) is regarded to be a promising high-capacity anode material for LIBs. However, the capacity attenuates fast and the rate performance is poor due to the dramatic pulverization and sluggish charge transfer properties. To solve these problems, a simple in situ encapsulation and composite method was successfully developed to construct carbon nanotube/nanorod/nanosheet-supported Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Owing to the hierarchical architecture design, the novel structure Fe 3 O 4 @C nanocomposites effectively enhance the charge transfer, alleviate pulverization, avoid the agglomeration of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, and also provide superior kinetics toward lithium storage, thereby showing significantly improved reversibility and rate performance. The carbon nanotube/nanorod supported core-shell structure Fe 3 O 4 @C nanocomposite displays outstanding high rate capability and stable cycling performance (reversible capability of 1006, 552 and 423 mA h g −1 at 0.2, 0.5 and 1 A g −1 after running 100, 300 and 500 cycles, respectively).

Conditioning Solid-State Anode-Less Cells for the Next Generation of Batteries,"Manuela C. Baptista, Beatriz Moura Gomes, Diana Capela, Miguel F. S. Ferreira, Diana Guimarães, Nuno A. Silva, Pedro A.

Here, we have fabricated and tested two types of anode-less pouch cells, the first using solely a copper negative current collector and the other the same current collector but coated with a nucleation seed ZnO layer. Both types of cells used the same all-solid-state electrolyte, Li 2.99 Ba 0.005 ClO composite, in a cellulose matrix and a LiFePO 4 cathode. Direct and indirect methods confirmed Li metal anode plating after charging the cells. The direct methods are X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), a technique not divulged in the battery world but friendly to study the surface of the negative current collector, as it detects lithium. The indirect methods used were electrochemical cycling and impedance and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It became evident the presence of plated Li on the surface of the current collector in contact with the electrolyte upon charging, both directly and indirectly. A maximum average lithium plating thickness of 2.9 µm was charged, and 0.13 µm was discharged. The discharge initiates from a maximum potential of 3.2 V, solely possible if an anode-like high chemical potential phase, such as Li, would form while plating. Although the ratings and energy densities are minor in this study, it was concluded that a layer of ZnO, even at 25 °C, allows for higher discharge power for more hours than plain Cu. It was observed that where Li plates on ZnO, Zn is not detected or barely detected by XPS. The present anode-less cells discharge quickly initially at higher potentials but may hold a discharge potential for many hours, likely due to the ferroelectric character of the electrolyte.

Replacing Ni with abundant and low-cost Zn makes the ZEBRA battery more cost-effective. However, few studies were performed on this next-generation ZEBRA (Na-ZnCl 2 ) battery system, particularly on its AlCl 3 -NaCl-ZnCl 2 secondary electrolyte. Its properties such as phase diagrams and vapor pressures are vital for the cell design and optimization. In our previous work, a simulation-assisted method for molten salt electrolyte selection has shown its successful application in development of molten salt batteries. The same method is used here to in-depth study the AlCl 3 -NaCl-ZnCl 2 salt electrolyte in terms of its phase diagrams and vapor pressures via FactSage TM and thermo-analytical techniques (Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and OptiMelt TM ), and their effects on battery performance such as operation safety and charging/discharging reaction mechanism. The DSC and OptiMelt results show that the experimental data such as melting temperatures and phase changes agree well with the simulated phase diagrams. Moreover, the FactSage TM simulation shows that the salt vapor pressure increases significantly with increasing temperature and molar fraction of AlCl 3 . The obtained phase diagrams and vapor pressures will be used in the secondary electrolyte selection, cell design and battery operation. Full article"

Nanocomposite PVDF Membrane for Battery Separator Prepared via Hot Pressing,"Lukáš Plesník, Karla Čech Barabaszová, Sylva Holešová, Pavlína Peikertová, Gražyna Simha Martynková, Damian Stanislaw Nakonieczny",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9080398,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/398/pdf?version=1690796932,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/398,7,"Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is one of the materials most commonly used in membrane separators. The structures of pristine PVDF and PVDF nanocomposite films were processed via hot pressing at 140 °C, 170 °C, and 185 °C at a pressure of 2 tons for 15 min. According to a surface investigation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the spherulitic character of the PVDF nanocomposite films was preserved up to a pressing temperatures of 140 °C. The cross-sectional SEM images confirmed that higher pressing temperatures (170 °C) caused the structures to be compacted into monolithic films, and a pressing temperature of 185 °C caused the melting of the PVDF matrix and its recrystallization into thin films (21–29 μm). An average crystallinity value of 51.5% was calculated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and this decreased as the pressing temperature increased. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements confirmed the presence of a dominant γ phases in the PVDF nanocomposite films, whose nanofillers consisted of vermiculite particles (ZnO_V and ZnO_V_CH) and mixed α + γ phases. The percentage of the electroactive γ phase (approximately 79%) was calculated via a FTIR analysis, and the ratio between the β phase and the α phase was determined from the Raman spectra. A hydrophilic surface with contact angles ranging from 61 to 84° was demonstrated for all the PVDF nanocomposite membranes. The superoleophilic surface was measured using poly(dimethylsiloxane) with contact angles ranging from 4 to 13°, and these angles reached lower values when in contact with sulfur particles.

Simulating the Electrochemical-Thermal Behavior of a Prismatic Lithium-Ion Battery on the Market under Various Discharge Cycles,"Luca Magri, Luigi Sequino, Cristian Ferrari",2023,https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries9080397,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/397/pdf?version=1691026848,https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/9/8/397,11,"In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict the transient temperature distributions of a prismatic lithium-ion polymer battery (LiPo) cooled by natural convection at various discharge cycles is developed. The thermal behavior of a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cell is important for its safety, performance and degradation, and it requires both measurement and modeling. However, most existing thermal models for Li-ion battery cells only account for steady-state temperature fields, while the exercise of a Li-ion battery cell is usually transitory. The Newman’s pseudo-2D approach was used to perform an electrochemical CFD analysis. This approach treats the porous electrode as a collection of equal-sized, isotropic, homogeneous spherical particles. This simplifies the electrode microstructure and assumes a smooth and uniform lithium insertion/extraction in the electrode. The model has been validated through variable discharge rate experimental tests in a controlled chamber. Additionally, infrared images of the battery cell during discharging are taken and the experimental numerical gradient temperature was compared. We have validated the CFD simulations by comparing the temperature, state of charge and voltage curves with experimental data. The model predictions match the experimental data very well. The difficulty in CFD battery simulations with an electrochemical approach lies in the setting of many physical parameters that are difficult to find. In this work, the parameters’ characteristics of the simulated battery are assumed and validated; these can be useful for modeling batteries of the same type. Consequently, the model developed in this work can be applied to predict the temperature distribution of the LiPo prismatic battery and can be used by the battery designers and by the designers of all systems that include batteries.

This work presents the application of a new methodology that enables diagnosis without the need for any maintenance cycle. It uses a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network trained on the output from a clear sky irradiance model and validated on the observed irradiances for 720 days of synthetic battery data generated from pyranometer irradiance observations. The analysis was performed from three angles: the impact of sky conditions, degradation composition, and degradation extent. Our results indicate that for days with over 50% clear sky or with an average irradiance over 650 W/m 2 , diagnosis with an average RMSE of 1.75% is obtainable independent of the composition of the degradation and of its extent.

The pre-oxidation step, which is not part of the secondary battery manufacturing process, makes the manufacturing of tertiary batteries complex and costly. To omit the pre-oxidation step, we used partially oxidized Prussian blue analogs, i.e., Na x Co[Fe(CN) 6 ] y z H 2 O (Co-PBA) and Na x Ni[Fe(CN) 6 ] y z H 2 O (Ni-PBA), as cathode and anode materials.

However, due to the pseudo-positive definiteness of the covariance matrix and noise statistics error accumulation, the SOC estimation of lithium-ion batteries is usually inaccurate or even divergent using Kalman filters, such as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF). To resolve this problem, an SOC estimation method based on the dual-coefficient tracking improved square-root unscented Kalman filter for lithium-ion batteries is developed. The method is composed of an improved square-root unscented Kalman filter (ISRUKF) and a dual-coefficient tracker. To avoid the divergence of SOC estimation due to the covariance matrix with pseudo-positive definiteness, an ISRUKF based on the QR decomposition covariance square-root matrix is presented. Moreover, the dual-coefficient tracker is designed to track and correct the state noise error of the battery, which can reduce the SOC estimation error caused by the accumulation of the battery model error using the ISRUKF. The accuracy and robustness of the SOC estimation method using the developed method are validated by the comparison with the UKF and SRUKF. The developed algorithm shows the highest SOC estimation accuracy with the SOC error within 1.5%. Full article"
